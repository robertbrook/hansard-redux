        The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 37 would insert a new subsection into Clause 20, which sets up fee scales for local government audits in Wales. The amendment says that the fees must not exceed the profit of the audit. This is a probing amendment, designed to find out how the system will work in practice.

        As I understand the Audit Commission arrangements, there is a scale of audit fees that applies for all audits. The bodies pay the audit fees into the centre, after which they are passed on to individual auditors, whether in the private sector or in the Audit Commission. A margin is kept at the centre to fund and effect the technical support costs of dealing with local government audits. Will that situation apply in Wales, with a surplus over the costs of the individual auditors going towards funding the central technical costs? How will the level of that compare with English audits, given that the scale of operation in Wales will be much smaller and there will probably not be a different size of technical function? Will there be a higher level of cost in Wales because of the new arrangements involving separate audit? Have any calculations yet been made of the costs under the new arrangements compared with those under the existing arrangements? I hope the Minister will be able to shed some light on these matters. I beg to move.

            I recognise the probing nature of this amendment. The Auditor General for Wales, as now, will broadly seek to balance income and expenditure. The reason why we would not be able to accept the amendment is that it would ensure that the Auditor General resets fees calculated to recover no more than the actual costs of the audit. I think the noble Baroness will recognise that there are other costs which are legitimate.</p><p>
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_116gc' title='Col. 116GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 February 2004 vol 658 c116GC' name='column_116gc' href='#column_116gc' rel='bookmark'>116GC</a>
            The proportion of the fee income derived from the scale of fees would be used to fund the undertaking and promotion of economy, efficiency and effectiveness studies. Other studies are to be undertaken under Clauses 41 and 42.</p><p>
            Fee income would also be needed to make the Auditor General's central administrative costs relevant to his local government audit function, including the costs of negotiating and maintaining contractual arrangements.</p><p>
            The clause represents a continuation of the fee-setting arrangements already in place in respect of local government audit in England and Wales. The arrangements, as the noble Baroness knows rather better than I do, are tried and tested, and the clause ensures that they will continue to be subject to full consultation with local government and other interested parties.</p><p>
            At present, I understand that the Audit Commission retains a percentage of its gross audit and inspection fee income to cover its central administrative costs and its economy, efficiency and effectiveness study costs. The charging arrangements are tried and tested, and Welsh local government did not raise any concerns over the intention to preserve them during the process of consultation in pre-legislative scrutiny.

            I am grateful to the noble Baroness for making that additional point. This will be a matter for the Auditor General to decide in terms of the margin. I believe that, at present, the margin is about 9 per cent in respect of the Audit Commission. Although costings have not yet been fully carried out, we would expect it to be within a similar range.

            Clause 21 is curious and, I suggest, possibly unnecessary. Clause 20 provides that the Auditor General will prescribe the scale or scales of fees payable following consultation. I should have thought that that consultation, which involves both local authorities and bodies of accountants, would be sufficient. Subsection (4) states that they must pay, although it is probably inconceivable that they would refuse to do so.</p><p>
            However, Clause 21 contains provision for the Assembly to prescribe alternative or substitute scales&#x2014;again, following consultation. What is the point of this clause? No real reason is given for this formulation. We believe that the clause may not be wholly innocuous because it may encourage dissension and make
            
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_117gc' title='Col. 117GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 February 2004 vol 658 c117GC' name='column_117gc' href='#column_117gc' rel='bookmark'>117GC</a>
            agreement under Clause 20 more difficult because of the reserve power under Clause 21 which can be brought into effect.</p><p>
            The Explanatory Notes talk about the Assembly considering the scales to be excessive or about there being a conflict of views. But, if that is the case, it cannot seriously be suggested that the Auditor General should, in effect, be compelled to carry out work for less than the costs that he thinks he should recover. Therefore, we find it difficult to see what proper place Clause 21 has in the Bill.

            This is not a new power that is being conferred on the Assembly. The Assembly already has the power to prescribe fees under Section 7 of the <a href="/acts/audit-commission-act-1998">Audit Commission Act 1998</a>, together with the National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999. Clause 21 preserves the status quo. It would be open to the Assembly to exercise the power if, for example, it considered the scale of fees set by the Auditor General for Wales to be excessive or if there were an impasse between the Auditor General and local government on this issue. In doing so, the Assembly would be required to consult the Auditor General, associations of local government in Wales and any bodies of accountants which appeared to be appropriate.</p><p>
            Exercise of the power would not in any way compromise the constitutional independence of local government. The fact that it is a failsafe provision and has not as yet, in practice, been used by the Assembly should not devalue it as a safeguard.</p><p>
            Apart from eliminating that safeguard, deletion of the clause would remove an important mechanism for dispute resolution. It would not be appropriate to take away a statutory power already conferred on the National Assembly. The Welsh Local Government Association did not raise any concerns on this clause during the periods of pre-legislative scrutiny or public consultation. Therefore, on that basis, I can reassure the noble Baroness with regard to her concern.

            Perhaps I may raise one question with the Minister. My concern was not the constitutional position of local government but the position of the Auditor General for Wales and whether or not he would, in effect, be compelled to do the work for less than the costs that he would incur, including the central cost to which the noble Lord referred earlier.</p><p>
            If the Assembly sets a lower fee-scale for local authorities, does that mean that the residual costs will be within the budget for the Auditor General for Wales and will therefore, in any event, be picked up by the Assembly? What happens to the costs that are not recovered on local authority audits? That is my question.

Amendment No. 38 applies to Clause 24 and public interest reports. It deletes the four bodies currently listed in subsection (3) and replaces them with the nine bodies listed in Clause 12(1).

        When a Clause 24 report in the public interest is made, the body concerned must consider the report as soon as possible, but that refers to only the four kinds of bodies in subsection (3). The additional bodies are covered by the procedure in Clause 25. The real point of tabling the amendment is to ask why we have that differentiation. Given the replies that we have received in the past, I suspect that that is more to do with previous legislation than with any point of principle and may, indeed, represent a further area where rationalisation of the Bill could usefully be carried out.

        Amendment No. 39 is the obverse of Amendment No. 38 and poses in another way the question why there is different treatment for the four types of bodies. Amendment No. 51 is on the same theme. It proposes to add the four bodies in Clause 24(3) to the relevant bodies whose performance standards are covered by Sections 47 and 49. We are probing why those bodies are excluded from the list at this stage. I beg to move.

            First, the one-month deadline is consistent with the existing position. It is a tougher provision than "as soon as practicable". It is imposed on the larger bodies because we think we have the right to make those demands upon them. They have the administrative support to enable them to meet such requirements in ways in which it might be thought possible for the smaller local government bodies, for example, port health authorities, internal drainage boards and so forth. For those bodies, "as soon as practicable" will apply because one month might be too rigorous a deadline for them to meet. The one-month deadline for the larger bodies is consistent with the tighter timescale introduced on an England and Wales basis by the <a href="/acts/local-government-act-2003">Local Government Act 2003</a>. Prior to that it had been four months but that Act reduced it to one month. We are enforcing this rigour in Wales consistent with that position.</p><p>
            Amendment No. 51 would also impact on the smaller local government bodies set out in Clause 12(1). The amendment would extend to them the requirement to

            comply with the provisions in respect of the publication of information relating to performance standards set out in Clauses 47 to 49. We believe that this would risk imposing an unnecessary burden on bodies with a very limited range of functions and where comparison may in any event be difficult and not particularly informative as to performance.</p><p>
            We contend that extending the scope of the performance standards provisions in the Bill should be at the discretion of the National Assembly. As currently drafted, the clause gives the Assembly the power to add to the list of bodies not currently within the provisions of Clauses 47 to 49. On that basis I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

            I thank the Minister for that reply, which certainly explains how the current Bill has been drafted. I shall confine myself at this stage merely to remark again that it is a pity that an opportunity has not been taken to consider all these areas afresh instead of copying the existing legislative pattern. Just because a body is small does not mean that it should be excused from responding on a rapid basis where a public interest report is concerned. So, I am not sure that a less stringent regime is necessarily desirable for smaller bodies. However, this is part of a general regime that we have debated and doubtless will debate again in the context of the Bill. For today, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

        The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 40, I wish to speak also to Amendment No. 41. Both of these amendments are probing amendments in relation to Clause 30, which deals with certain inspection rights which apply during audits of local government bodies.

        Subsection (1) allows what is referred to as "an interested person" to inspect the accounts to be audited and related documents. My amendment would delete "an interested person" on a probing basis and replace it with "a person". The amendment seeks to probe who the "interested person" is. Subsection (2) refers to local government electors and so the "interested person" is presumably someone other than a local government elector for the area. I hope that the Minister will explain who these people are and why Clause 30 has the rights of apparently different groups embedded in it.

        The rights to information and documents in Clause 30 do not apply to "personal information" which is defined in subsection (4) in a very restrictive way. Basically, personal information is the fact that a person is employed by the body and/or paid by the body in respect of an employment by someone else. I paraphrase but that is the drift. My Amendment No. 42 says that personal information includes but is not restricted to that information.

        I am quite sure that electors and others should not have unrestricted access to personal information but this definition seems to allow them to have access to all kinds of personal data such as age or marital status, home addresses and so on. Being restricted to employees, it appears to allow access to personal data about applicants for council tax benefit or grants, including means tested data. I could go on.

        The Explanatory Notes at paragraph 76 note that the right to information may also be restricted by the <a href="/acts/data-protection-act-1984">Data Protection Act</a>. If that is the case&#x2014;and, of course, that Act would cover the information that I have mentioned&#x2014;it seems to me to be unsatisfactory that this Bill makes no reference to that Act and appears on the face of it as if there were very considerable access rights available to electors and others. I am trying to find out why the Bill has been drafted in this way. It appears to raise hopes regarding obtaining information but you find out only by referring to the <a href="/acts/data-protection-act-1984">Data Protection Act</a>&#x2014;which is not mentioned in the clause&#x2014;that that information may be restricted.

            I approach this amendment with a certain circumspection. I remember a certain police authority getting into difficulties interpreting what information needed to be passed on. I am conscious of the fact&#x2014;as I think we all are&#x2014;that we need to tread carefully with regard to the provisions of the <a href="/acts/data-protection-act-1984">Data Protection Act</a>. The noble Baroness will forgive me if I stick fairly closely to the brief which I have, which I hope will deal with the points she made.</p><p>
            The intention is to exclude vexatious persons who are making trivial and frivolous approaches for information, but not to cut out anyone who has an interest, including an individual elector. The Bill does not exclude a local taxpayer or a local resident because they clearly are likely to have an interest in the information. The clause as drafted enables such persons to inspect or make copies of documents relating to the accounts at an audit of a local government body. It also gives a local elector or his representative the right to question the auditor about the accounts.</p><p>
            In practice, the reference to an "interested person" is very unlikely to represent a practical impediment to a person wishing to exercise a reasonable right of inspection. However, the terminology in the Bill would entitle the local government body auditor to withstand the entreaties of an individual or body whose requests were of a vexatious or frivolous nature.</p><p>
            
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_121gc' title='Col. 121GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 February 2004 vol 658 c121GC' name='column_121gc' href='#column_121gc' rel='bookmark'>121GC</a>
            Amendment No. 41 would widen the definition of "personal information" to which a person is not entitled in an inspection of the accounts or related documents or in questions to the auditor. We are not quite clear that the amendment would give an accurate definition of who was included and who was not, and we believe that it could lead to confusion and misunderstanding. Much of what a lay person would consider "personal information" will be protected by the <a href="/acts/data-protection-act-1998">Data Protection Act 1998</a>. I do not believe that additional protection by third parties is necessary in the context of the Bill.</p><p>
            I hope that on that basis, the noble Baroness will feel that I have covered the issues on Amendment No. 40. On Amendment No. 41, the <a href="/acts/data-protection-act-1998">Data Protection Act 1998</a> relates mainly to information held electronically. Subsection (5) goes wider to cover information held in manual form also.

            I thank the Minister for that reply and will consider it carefully. I accept that the <a href="/acts/data-protection-act-1998">Data Protection Act 1998</a> is limited in scope in that respect.

            I shall consider what the Minister said on the question of "vexatious" requests. I find it rather curious drafting that to eliminate a vexatious person one drafts the other way around to allow an "interested person"&#x2014;the implication being that almost anyone could apply, but to be deemed not interested is equivalent to being vexatious. That is a rather curious way in which to approach the construction of a statute.

            I have listened closely to the remarks of the noble Baroness. I can only plead the obvious point in defence that she may not be entirely happy with the drafting, but the effect is to go as wide as possible&#x2014;wider than the individual elector. If the person came in with serious and proper intent, the obligation would be to provide that information. If we are erring, the error is in being as open and accountable as possible. I shall just have to accept the fact that the noble Baroness is not entirely happy with the drafting.

        description "advisory notice" for what is, after all, a rather dire warning that the body is about to incur unlawful expenditure or commit some other unlawful act, as set out in subsection (2), is, to say the least, euphemistic. I know that it derives from other legislation; that is one of the problems that we have had in considering the Bill. However, surely it is time that we changed nomenclature and called a spade a spade. Warning notices might even make the authorities more alert.

Amendment No. 42 would seek to change the name of such a notice from advisory to warning. In all other respects we would have the same provision.</p><p>
            I think that "advisory" is the most appropriate description of the notice and its purpose. A notice can be issued, if circumstances dictate, to inform a body that it has acted illegally. In this context, to describe it as a warning when the event has already happened might not be entirely appropriate.</p><p>
            From the wider standpoint I am of the view that the word "advisory" probably more accurately reflects the relationship between auditor and client, where the former is a source of advice and assistance to the latter rather than providing the scrutiny function.</p><p>
            The word "advisory" is a more fitting description of the nature of the notice and I believe reflects the positive nature of the relationship that exists between most auditors and the bodies to which they are appointed. Therefore, I prefer "advisory" to "warning".

            The Minister was almost persuasive until he got on to auditors being advisers, which they most certainly are not. They are not there to be advisers; they are there to carry out the rigours of public audit. But I take the earlier part of what the Minister said and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

        The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 43 is a probing amendment to Clause 37, which deals with the situation when an extraordinary audit may be called. That can be done by the Auditor General or if he has had an application from a single local government elector which he would have to consider.

        Application by a solitary elector is all very well and could be genuine, but this provision could result in vexatious or time wasting applications. If an elector

        thought that an extraordinary audit was required, it seems that that elector would be more carefully listened to and could be entitled to more airtime if he or she was supported by four others of the same opinion, which is what this probing amendment proposes.

        Perhaps the Minister could explain the rationale for exposing the Auditor General to the opinions of single electors which could be on single-issue matters of no concern to the wider community. Will he say whether this single elector ability has proved necessary in England or, indeed, Wales prior to the Bill, to allow the right kinds of issues to be raised, or whether it has proved to be vexatious? We want to get this issue right for Wales. I beg to move.

            While it could be argued that the increase in threshold may eliminate applications of a frivolous or vexatious nature, it could of course equally deprive one or two people who have a genuine case of the right to apply. There have been instances where one or two individuals requested an extraordinary audit with the result of illegal expenditure being identified. I am looking for a precise instance to give to the noble Baroness. I do not have one immediately to hand, but I may have one shortly. If so, I shall of course quote it. But we contend that it has been used. On one or two occasions there have been instances where two people have presented a proper case.</p><p>
            The danger of course is that the amendment would limit this right. The power to direct an extraordinary audit is after all a discretionary one, so the Auditor General could decline an application from whatever number of people, if he thought it was not soundly based. In principle, I feel that the amendment would limit the public's right to make legitimate representations. I had hoped to consolidate my case with a dramatic and significantly &#x2014;

            Perhaps I may intervene briefly in this dialogue. I am not surprised that that resulted in an audit. It seems that the Bill as drafted is sensible. It does not require the Auditor General to conduct the audit; it is discretionary. If he exercises that discretion improperly there is always the remedy of judicial review of which the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, does not think very much, but which we think is a very important safeguard, particularly in other legislation that is about to come before the House.

        Clause 39 deals with accounting regulations. Noble Lords will be pleased to know that I shall not be delving into the intricacies of local government accounting. My concern is that the regulations can create a criminal offence of non-compliance with the regulations, and that this creation of a criminal offence is made only by regulations made by the Assembly without any parliamentary procedure.

        We have been told several times throughout our consideration of the Bill that the local government arrangements are designed to mirror the equivalent arrangements under the <a href="/acts/audit-commission-act-1998">Audit Commission Act</a>; and Clause 39 indeed mirrors Section 27 of that Act. But my point is that the regulations themselves may differ and the Assembly could create a criminal offence where none exists in England. One of the principles the Minister told us about on Monday was that there should be equivalence&#x2014;especially as regards the criminal law&#x2014;between England and Wales. That is an additional reason why we believe that Parliament has a positive duty to be involved in the regulations made under this section.

            I am grateful to both Members of the Committee but I am more grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, for his critical argument. The simple fact is that, as he said, the amendment would restrict a power which the National Assembly already has by virtue of Section 27 of the <a href="/acts/audit-commission-act-1998">Audit Commission Act</a> and the National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999. Accounts and audit regulations allow for a different approach between England and Wales in interpreting noncompliance as an offence between England and Wales. To date, the approach has been consistent on a cross-border basis.</p><p>
            Before making any such regulations, the Assembly would be required to consult the Auditor General, local government and the accountancy bodies. Like the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, I believe that it would be extraordinary if, in this fairly modest Bill, we ripped away from the National Assembly a power which it already has, and I wonder whether the noble Baroness will press matters that far.</p><p>
            The key principle here is that the Assembly's existing ability to make regulations should not be restricted by the Bill. The Assembly has wide powers in relation to local government finance in Wales and it is appropriate that they should include the power to decide what is and is not an offence in the context of the preparation of local government accounts.</p><p>
            If there was a hint in what the noble Baroness said that my stance on this amendment might be contrary to my stance on other criminal provisions in the Bill, perhaps I should take up the kind invitation of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, and seek to clarify that as best as I can.</p><p>
            The subject matter of the Bill is not a devolved issue. Therefore, the decision on what conduct should constitute a criminal offence in that context is for the UK Government. The UK Government are not prepared to create an inconsistency in the Bill by decriminalising for Wales conduct which would constitute a criminal offence in England. That is the basis of our position.

            For the first time. I am mystified by that response because it seems to me that Clause 39 allows precisely for the result that the Minister said the Government were not prepared to allow, but perhaps I missed something.

            But would it not be the case that the Assembly could pass regulations which do not create criminal offences for certain conduct&#x2014;for example, non-compliance with certain accounting regulations&#x2014;which, in England, could constitute a criminal offence? In relation to Wales, the Assembly could do things differently. That is my point and that was the source of my mystification. It seems to me that the clause allows precisely the result that the Minister said he was not prepared to allow.

            I am grateful to both Members of the Committee. Once again, I was seeking to identify an underlying principle in the Bill. The Bill is concerned with the role of the National Assembly and the role of the Auditor General in relation to their respective functions. But the constant theme throughout the Bill is that, so far as concerns conduct, there should be a consistency of treatment on either side of the border.

            The noble Baroness is quite right in saying that the regulations may not make the same provision in England and Wales. Breach of the regulations in England would be a criminal offence as would breach of the regulations in Wales, but it does not mean to say that the conduct will he the same under the regulations. It depends upon the way in which the regulations are structured.

        I am not sure that the wording of the amendment is correct. I think that my noble friend Lord Roberts was trying to insert the words of the amendment after the words "for a police area in Wales", not trying to delete those words. I hope that that has not confused the Minister as it did me when I came to prepare for the amendment.

        The point is that the amendment seeks to anticipate the effect of the Bill yet to be passed that will change the organisation of the fire services and increase their scope and importance. It seems to us to be important that the powers of the Auditor General properly reflect that. I beg to move.

            We consider that there is a clear distinction of some import between police authorities and fire authorities and that is why there is a difference in the clause.</p><p>
            The membership of police authorities is only partially made up of elected members from their constituent local authorities. Half the membership of police authorities comprise magistrates and independent members, as I am sure the noble Baroness is aware. Police authorities also have their own separate funding arrangements within the annual Welsh local government revenue settlement and they receive revenue funding through Home Office police grant.</p><p>
            On the other hand, fire authorities wholly comprise elected members from their constituent local authorities. They also precept on their constituent local authorities for funding. There is therefore no reason why the procedure for dealing with public interest reports should differ from that set out in the Bill for any other wholly elected local government body set out in the Bill. Fire authorities, like their constituent local authorities, are responsible to their local electorate.

            The amendment is constructive, but we are not convinced that it is necessary.

        (1) Studies carried out under section 41 or 42 may include comparative studies involving local government bodies in England if the Auditor General for Wales considers it desirable to do so for the purposes of his analysis of local government bodies in Wales.

        The noble Baroness said: I rise to move Amendment No. 47, which inserts a new clause after Clause 42&#x2014;and I will also speak to Amendment No. 71. The new clause inserted by the amendment would allow the Auditor General for Wales to extend his value for money studies to English local government bodies, provided that he consults the Secretary of State and the Audit Commission. That is to ensure that the Auditor General for Wales can harness the full power of comparative studies when it appears to him that confining himself to Welsh local government bodies would not give a comprehensive analysis.

        The effect of various amendments in Schedule 2 to the <a href="/acts/audit-commission-act-1998">Audit Commission Act</a> is that the Audit Commission in England will be able to include Welsh bodies in its studies. That seems eminently sensible provided that the inspection burden on Welsh bodies is not excessive. But there is no corresponding power for the Auditor General and so he must look only at Welsh bodies when carrying out comparative studies.

        In practice, much will be capable of being achieved by co-operation between the Auditor General and the Audit Commission, but the Bill is ambiguous on co-operation. Under Clause 43 the Auditor General must co-operate with the Audit Commission when carrying out value for money functions under Clauses 41 and 42. The corresponding co-operation duty on the Audit Commission applies to the Audit Commission's equivalent functions. But neither requires one to co-operate with the other to assist with the other's value for money functions. So, Wales co-operates with England on Welsh studies and England co-operates with Wales on English studies, but England does not have to co-operate with Wales on Welsh studies&#x2014;or vice versa.

        The Audit Commission does not really need that co-operation from the Auditor General because it has power to cover Welsh bodies itself. But the Auditor General does not have the equivalent power, which is why I have tabled the amendment. If the Auditor General does not have that power, the quality of his value for money work in Wales may well be constrained by the willingness of the Audit Commission to give sufficient priority to concerns that exist in Wales, but which perhaps do not exist in England. I do not believe that that is a sound basis for proceeding.

        Amendment No. 71 is an alternative amendment to ensure that if the Auditor General does not have powers to include English bodies in his studies, then at least the Audit Commission must have a positive duty to co-operate in respect of the Auditor General's functions under Clauses 41 and 42. I beg to move.

            We do not consider Amendment No. 47 to be necessary because there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the Auditor General for Wales incorporating into his studies for comparative purposes data collected by the Audit Commission on English authorities. The information will be readily available. The Act requires the commission to publish the results of its studies. Equally, the commission will value data collected and held by the Auditor General on local government bodies in Wales for comparative purposes.</p><p>
            The Audit Commission retains the power under the <a href="/acts/audit-commission-act-1998">Audit Commission Act</a> to undertake cross-border studies in respect of local government bodies in England and Wales. In doing so it has to consult the Auditor General and take account of any relevant work done or being done by the Auditor General.</p><p>
            The expectation is that the cross-border work will involve joint working between the Auditor General for Wales and the commission. The co-operative provisions in the Bill are designed to achieve that. But the Bill does not make cross-border working mandatory because we do not wish unnecessarily to fetter the Auditor General and other audit and inspection bodies in progressing work and, as a result, have a restrictive rather than a facilitative effect.</p><p>
            Under the arrangements in the Bill I believe that the Auditor General will have access to information which the noble Baroness identified; namely, information

            relating to English local government bodies, without specifically undertaking studies in respect of them. It is because we think we have provided for cross-border working without making it mandatory but where it would suit the purposes of the Auditor General in his work that we consider it is not necessary to accept an amendment that would change that basis.

            I thank the Minister for that reply. However, that presumes that data already exist, as collected by the Audit Commission. I am sure that the Auditor General will have access to data that exist. However, my point is that the Auditor General for Wales may well wish to examine things which the Audit Commission has not examined in relation to English bodies. Without either the power to examine English bodies or the ability to require the co-operation of the Audit Commission, audits in Wales could be impoverished compared with audits in England. In England, if the Audit Commission wants to carry out studies which include comparative data from Wales, including, I assume, data which do not already exist, it can do so. It is wrong in principle that we should create in the Bill essentially a lower quality examination for Wales.</p><p>
            In practice I accept that with good will and co-operation the Audit Commission and the Auditor General will work together harmoniously. But we should not preclude the possibility that what would be a high agenda item for Wales would he a very low agenda item for England. There could be instances where, to produce a quality result for Wales, we would need to go further. I do not believe that this is one of the issues where we are wedded to existing legislation. I think that the Government even have a little wriggle room. I hope that the Minister will consider this further. I do not think that the answers he has given today have been adequate. I do not know whether he wants to say any more at present.

            I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving me the opportunity to extend my remarks briefly. The main purpose of the duties in Clause 43 is to produce a regulatory burden on the bodies' studies. We consider that the duties as drafted achieve that. As to co-operation for the purpose of assisting a fellow audit body&#x2014;the Auditor General for Wales or the Audit Commission, as the case may be&#x2014;which I believe was the burden of the remarks of the noble Baroness, we do not think it is necessary to make that a statutory duty. The power to co-operate for the benefit of either is contained in Clause 2 but it is on the basis of a framework in which co-operation can take place. We do not think that we need to make this statutory, which would be the effect of the amendment.

        The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 48 would delete subsection (2) from Clause 44. This clause deals with studies made at the request of local government bodies with a view to making recommendations to improve economy, efficiency and effectiveness. Subsection (2) states that before making the request, the local authority must consult "associations of employees"&#x2014;which I assume means the local trade union. My question is whether or not that is premature. I would understand if employees were consulted after the results of the study were known or if their job prospects were affected&#x2014;indeed, that is what both labour law and good labour relations would require&#x2014;but to consult the unions before a study, and to consult them regardless of whether the study potentially affects employees, seems to me both unnecessary and potentially harmful, not least to employees who might be needlessly worried and disturbed.

        It seems that the provision makes it unlikely that a local authority would seek the help of the Auditor General in improving its value for money. If the choice is between private sector consultants whose work can be carried out without prior consultation and the Auditor General, whose work has to be consulted upon, there clearly is an unlevel playing field. I am surprised if the Government's policy is to favour the use of private sector consultants over the Auditor General. I shall be interested in the Minister's response. I beg to move.

            We think that, as drafted, the Bill seeks merely to continue existing practice. The amendment therefore seems to be a step backwards. It could seriously impede the conduct of a study and consequently devalue the results. Any absence in the Bill of any requirement to consult would be in stark contrast to existing practice in England. I think that that would give rise to some concern in Wales. The measure gives employee organisations the opportunity to express views that would be valuable to the conduct of the study even if the association, whatever it was, had concerns over its conduct. After all, such concerns may themselves be informative to the study being conducted.</p><p>
            I say to the noble Baroness that consultation with an association even when it may not necessarily agree with what is going on is rather more positive than no consultation at all. All we are doing in this clause is to seek to continue existing practice.

            Existing practice favours using outside consultants rather than the Audit Commission at present and the Auditor General in future.

        It seems to me that if the Secretary of State asked for a study into benefit administration, there could be no valid reason for not publishing the outcome. Or, if the Secretary of State did not want to publish, it would be more likely that he would be influenced by political considerations in deciding whether to publish. That is why we think that obligatory publication would be better than some form of discretion. Alternatively, if there were good reasons for publication, we would be content to leave the discretion with the Auditor General. However, we do not think that the discretion on publication should be left with the Secretary of State. I beg to move.

            I thank the Minister for saying that the norm would be for such reports to be published. I shall reflect on what he has said and on whether between now and Report we should consider an alternative formulation involving discretion to the Auditor General.

        The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 52 deals with the publication of standards of performance by local authorities under Clause 47. It would enable comparisons to be made between the standards prevailing among Welsh authorities and similar authorities elsewhere in the UK. We believe that that would be desirable because it would give access to a greater pool of comparative data. I am not sure that the Auditor General is prevented from doing this under the Bill, but the amendment would put the matter beyond doubt. I beg to move.

            The normal position of the Committee thus far is for the noble Baroness to make a slightly longer speech and for my response to be somewhat briefer. On this occasion, however, she gets full marks for brevity and I shall have to give a slightly extended response as this is, as she will recognise, quite an important issue.</p><p>
            After wide-ranging consultation, the Audit Commission concluded that it would not exercise its powers under Sections 44 and 46 of the <a href="/acts/audit-commission-act-1998">Audit Commission Act 1998</a> to require the publication of performance indicators. That was in recognition of the fact that it would be best to focus on the development of statutory best value performance indicators set by the National Assembly under the <a href="/acts/local-government-act-1999">Local Government Act 1999</a>. The commission has worked with the Assembly in developing a robust performance management framework for best value. The commission retains the power to require publication, however, and I understand that it will keep the position under review. It is appropriate to retain the powers for the Auditor General under the Bill in order not to close off future options.</p><p>
            Amendment No. 52 could oblige local government bodies in Wales to publish information that would facilitate a comparison between their performance and
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_134gc' title='Col. 134GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 February 2004 vol 658 c134GC' name='column_134gc' href='#column_134gc' rel='bookmark'>134GC</a>
            the performance of similar authorities outside the Principality. It could also raise ambiguities over what a particular local government body regards as being a similar authority.</p><p>
            It would be open to the Auditor General for Wales to publish his own comparison in the form of Section 41 studies. That could certainly include comparative information available on English or other local authorities which, on an objective basis, are considered to have similar profiles.</p><p>
            Under Clause 6 of the <a href="/acts/local-government-act-1966">Local Government Act</a>, best value authorities must publish an annual performance plan&#x2014;now known in Wales as an improvement plan. The same requirement applies in England. The publication of such plans would allow cross-border comparison if authorities chose so to do. For that reason, I do not consider that the amendment would achieve what I believe to be its intended objective of facilitating objective and meaningful comparison of information relating to standards of performance.</p><p>
            I have spoken at some length, but, I hope, to good effect. I hope that the noble Baroness will accept the position as identified in this contribution.

        Te noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 53 deals with Clause 48, which concerns the methods of publishing information about standards and performance under Clause 47. I hear what the Minister says about this provision not being used at present, but since it will be held in reserve, it is important that we get it right.

        Amendment No. 53 would insert a new subsection to allow local authorities to publish the information electronically. I find it curious that Clause 48 is drafted without regard to the electronic age. I am aware that it is modelled on the <a href="/acts/audit-commission-act-1998">Audit Commission Act</a>. It is surprising that that Act, which is only about five years old, does not refer to electronic publishing. We are often told by the Government of their commitment to the electronic age, e-government and so on. Yet in a Bill which should pass into law in 2004, the Government are drafting legislation as if we had not moved on from the printing presses.

            We are in danger of being at crossed purposes. We agree about the objectives. We believe that within the framework of the Bill the amendment is not necessary because electronic publication is permitted.</p><p>
            The danger with the amendment is that it appears that it rules out other forms of communication. We certainly would not want to have electronically transmitted information at the exclusion of all other forms. I am sure that the noble Baroness does not intend that, but the amendment would have that effect. Even if I have misinterpreted the noble Baroness's amendment, I assure her that I am on her side. I assure her that the Bill provides the opportunity for e-mail and the Internet to be used. We do not need an amendment to this clause in order to do that.

        The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 54, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 55. Under Clause 47, the Auditor General will give directions to local authorities in Wales about publishing their performance standards.

            The publication of performance standards information is essentially a matter for the Auditor General and local government in Wales. There is no requirement on the Audit Commission to consult the National Assembly for Wales under the present arrangements. Local government might consider it an encroachment on its constitutional independence if, in fact, such a report were given to the Assembly.</p><p>
            The information which the Auditor General considers should be the subject of a direction can be informed by studies that he is required to undertake or promote under Clause 41. As the noble Baroness said, under Clause 49(3) the Auditor General would be required to consult any persons he thinks fit, other than the associations of relevant bodies, before imposing a new publication requirement. This could, of course, include the Assembly but there is no cause to impose a specific duty for him to do so.</p><p>
            A requirement to lay a copy of any direction before the Assembly would run counter to other measures relating to the Bill that underpin local government's independent democratic accountability, which we discussed extensively on a previous occasion. There is no requirement on the Auditor General, for instance, to lay a report on the financial audit of a local government body before the Assembly. Under Clause 49(6) the Auditor General is in any event required to publish a direction in order to bring it to the public attention. Therefore, I believe that the issues of public awareness and public information are covered so far as the work of the Auditor General is concerned. However, to include the Assembly in the measure would have significant implications so far as local authorities are concerned. On that basis I do not feel able to accept the amendment.

            I thank the Minister for giving the Government's reasons for resisting the amendment. We consider that the Assembly has a legitimate interest in local government, local government performance and perhaps even local government financial audit too.

However, on the basis that nothing would prevent the Auditor General consulting the Assembly&#x2014;we can trust the good sense of the Auditor General in that regard&#x2014;and that nothing would prevent him, in interpreting his requirement to publish the direction, ensuring that that was drawn to the attention of appropriate members of the Assembly, we are content with the Minister's response.

        The noble Baroness said: I shall be extremely brief. Paragraph 3 of Schedule I inserts a new Section 2A into the <a href="/acts/local-government-act-1999">Local Government Act 1999</a> to deal with the Welsh dimension of best value audit. Our Amendment No. 63 proposes the deletion of subsection (4) of new Section 2A.

        This is a probing amendment to find out exactly what the Government have in mind. Clearly, they intend to disapply or exempt from a functional duty certain best value authorities. The probing amendment is designed to ask the Minister to give us an example of how that might work in practice in Wales. I beg to move.

            As the noble Baroness said, the measure would limit the powers of the Assembly in a certain way. She will not be surprised if I therefore resist the amendment. Its effect would be to take away a power which the Assembly already has under the <a href="/acts/local-government-act-1999">Local Government Act 1999</a>. This is not, as I understand it, an exemption in the context of a relaxation of the best value authority's responsibilities. The power would be exercised if the Assembly had fundamental doubts about the exercise of a function by a best value authority and was contemplating making alternative arrangements. The Assembly has not used the power but that does not detract from its validity. We want to retain the power and we do not think that we should remove a power which the Assembly already has.

            I thank the Minister for that reply. I had understood that subsection (4) would have the effect of taking a body outside the ambit of best value. My probing amendment is to find out why that would happen in relation to a particular function or functions. I am not sure I understood what the Minister said in response to that.

            I was indicating that the power which would be taken away by the amendment would be exercised only if the Assembly had fundamental doubts about the exercise of the functions by a best value authority. The power has not been used, so I cannot quote an example to her. However, we want to preserve that power&#x2014;it is one which the Assembly already enjoys under the <a href="/acts/local-government-act-1966">Local Government Act</a>. That "reserve" power has validity and might be used in exceptional circumstances in respect of a best value authority when the Assembly has fundamental doubts about what is happening.

        The noble Lord said: On behalf of my noble friend, who is again unavoidably absent through illness, I move the amendment standing in his name. The amendments correct the fact that the draft Bill inadvertently resulted in the full provisions for consultation, approval and revision set out in Clause 16 not being applied to the code of practice in respect of best value audit. I can see from the amendments that have been tabled that our weaknesses were about to be exposed by Opposition amendments, and the government amendments have been tabled to recognise our weakness. The amendment reflects the fact that approval of, and consultation on, a draft code are dealt with in the full provisions of Clause 16. I beg to move.

        The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 67, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 68 and 70, which are probing amendments. Paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 inserts a new Section 10A into the <a href="/acts/local-government-act-1999">Local Government Act 1999</a> to deal with best value compliance work by the Auditor General for Wales. But the new section talks in terms of the Secretary of State giving directions to the Auditor General. The simple question posed by my amendments asks why the new section refers to the Secretary of State and not the Assembly. Is the Assembly to have no say in those best value inspections? What role does the Secretary of State have, and which Secretary of State is it?

The amendments are not necessary as Section 29 of the <a href="/acts/local-government-act-1999">Local Government Act 1999</a> already substitutes the National Assembly for the Secretary of State in respect of Part 1 best-value provisions.

        The subsection reads oddly in this context, probably because the Auditor General has a dual role. Under subsection (2), he may be subject to a direction from the Secretary of State, who has consulted him under subsection (3) about the appropriateness of it. The direction, with which he must comply, will be to carry out an inspection of a best-value authority in relation to specified functions.

            Amendment No. 69 would mean that the Auditor General would not be required to have regard to a recommendation by a best-value authority's auditor or Assembly guidance in coming to a decision on whether to undertake an inspection of a best-value authority's compliance with the best-value requirements set out in the <a href="/acts/local-government-act-1999">Local Government Act 1999</a>. He would, however, be required to have regard to them in undertaking an inspection.

            whereby the Auditor General can choose whether or not to carry out an inspection under subsection (1) or be directed under subsection (2). I should like to leave the Minister with the thought that in subsection (4) the word "and" would be better replaced with the word "or" so that the subsection would read:
            <q>In carrying out an inspection, or in deciding whether to do so".</q>
            That would reflect the fact that different things are being carried out under different parts of this new subsection. I believe that the drafting is ambiguous because of the way in which the issue is constructed. However, this is a matter for parliamentary counsel. I hope that the Minister's officials will put that point to parliamentary counsel and perhaps we shall be able to return to it at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

            The Minister will see that we have plenty of time left in Grand Committee to debate Clause 54 stand part, as we have reached this point well ahead of my target time&#x2014;which I am sure he will be pleased about.</p><p>
            This is probably the most contentious part of the Bill. We believe that the clause, with its presumption against disclosure of information and criminal sanctions for non-compliance has no part in a civilised audit regime. We are not alone in this&#x2014;the clause was disliked by the Welsh Affairs Committee in another place and the Assembly committee in its pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill. The committee in another place recommended its deletion and the substitution of a protocol for the clearance of the factual contents of local authority reports in consultation with those involved. That is the kind of procedure that the Auditor General is well versed in using.</p><p>
            We have since had the Government's response to the committee's report, to the effect that they have given careful consideration to the recommendation and come to the conclusion that the clause should be retained, with the only reason given being consistency with the Audit Commission arrangements in England. We have debated that rationale&#x2014;or non-rationale&#x2014;on several occasions in our Committee, and I believe that the Government's arguments have got thinner and less convincing as we have gone through the Bill.</p><p>
            The Government's position runs counter to devolution, which I believed&#x2014;although I am not an expert on devolution&#x2014;was supposed to allow Scottish and Welsh people to do their own thing, even if that means that there is a difference between them and the rest of the UK. The general practice has been to allow such differences to emerge&#x2014;but not in this case.</p><p>
            
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_141gc' title='Col. 141GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 February 2004 vol 658 c141GC' name='column_141gc' href='#column_141gc' rel='bookmark'>141GC</a>
            Much has been made of the criminal sanctions in the clause and the potential inconsistency in criminal law between England and Wales, which we have already discussed. The same point could not be made in respect of Scotland, because there are already inconsistencies between Scottish and English criminal law. We have already exposed in Committee the fact that the Bill itself, in Clause 39, opens up the possibility that criminal sanctions will diverge between Wales and England. Therefore, we do not regard it as an argument of principle.</p><p>
            The thrust of the clause is to restrict disclosure of information; indeed, that is its title. We are here dealing with local democratically elected authorities that are accountable to their electorate. The instinctive reaction is that the conduct of their affairs should be open and above board. Of course, there are items such as personal and social security data and criminal investigation material that should be handled with great care. However, common sense and the <a href="/acts/freedom-of-information-act-2000">Freedom of Information Act 2000</a> should see to that. Those matters do not warrant the inclusion of a blanket restriction on an auditor. Such a restriction implies that the body has something to hide from the public and must be protected. That is why the press and the unions have such an interest in the clause, as they see it as a way of silencing whistle blowers. I understand that the Auditor General himself has no desire for the clause, and I urge the Government to accept its deletion. I beg to move.

            We fully support the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and her party in seeking the deletion of Clause 50&#x2014;or Clause 54, as it now is. I called it Clause 50 because that is how it was originally drafted, and I am looking at the Government's response to the fifth report of the Welsh Affairs Committee, in which the Government set out their reasoning for retaining it. We were told about that at Second Reading, when I made a very long speech on this point, which I do not propose to repeat today.</p><p>
            In giving their reason for not deleting the clause, the Government said:
            <q>As a consequence there would be potential for the disclosure of the same information being treated inconsistently for the purposes of the criminal law in Wales and England. The Government is of the view that such a situation would be inappropriate and that any future consideration of the disclosure issue should be on an England and Wales basis. For this reason it does not propose to delete the provision from the draft Bill".</q>
            Earlier this afternoon we debated a situation in which there will be different criminal laws in England and Wales. As soon as we pass regulations&#x2014;as the National Assembly is fully entitled to do&#x2014;and apply criminal sanctions in breach of those regulations, we create a separate body of criminal law in Wales. The Government do that consistently in the Bill and do it also in the National Assembly, where their own party is in power. Therefore, it is no principle on which to base a Bill that effectively squashes the Auditor General's reports relating to local government issues. The measure gives an
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_142gc' title='Col. 142GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 February 2004 vol 658 c142GC' name='column_142gc' href='#column_142gc' rel='bookmark'>142GC</a>
            opportunity to a local government that is embarrassed by the contents of a report to withhold those contents from the public. That is absolutely unacceptable.</p><p>
            I hope that the Government will take this opportunity to lead the way in getting rid of these provisions, which were introduced via another party's government in 1972&#x2014;the rationale for which I have not yet been able to discover&#x2014;and introduce a modern system of auditing which allows the public to know what is going on in local government.</p><p>
            I have received correspondence from people in Flintshire and in the Rhondda, Cynon, Taff area who are concerned with matters within their authority area, which I do not propose to go into. They feel that this clause provides an opportunity for squashing full public discussion on contentious issues in those areas. Accordingly, we hope that the Government will give the Committee some comfort on this matter before we reach Report, when, if necessary, we shall do all within our power as a party to remove it from the Bill.

            It is clear that this issue presents probably the greatest controversy in the Bill. I want to set out the Government's position. I am happy to indicate both to the noble Baroness and to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, that I hope to conclude on a reasonably constructive note while, at the same time, making clear why we have taken this position in the Bill.</p><p>
            There is no new bar on disclosure of information in respect of Wales, although some have portrayed the issues in those terms. Clause 54 is equivalent in its effect to Section 49 of the <a href="/acts/audit-commission-act-1998">Audit Commission Act 1998</a>. In Clause 54 the Bill simply preserves the existing arrangements in both England and Wales.</p><p>
            The noble Lord commented on opportunities for a different approach in legislation and indicated a more modern system of auditing for local government. However, at this point I reflect that the Bill should not tread on any corns because it merely consolidates the existing position.</p><p>
            A person&#x2014;an auditor, a member of staff of the Auditor General for Wales or anyone else who had managed to get hold of the information&#x2014;in either England or Wales who disclosed without good reason information in contravention of the exceptions set out in Section 49 (2) would be guilty of an offence that could result in a term of imprisonment. If the Bill were to be enacted without this clause, the same action in Wales would not be an offence.</p><p>
            I am aware of the extent of opposition to Clause 54. That was identified by the noble Baroness and, indeed, by the noble Lord. However, it would be incongruous for the same act of disclosure to result in a prison sentence of up to two years in England and not be an offence in Wales. As I said in debates on earlier amendments, the Government are not prepared to create such an inconsistency in primary legislation. It is the Government's view that any consideration of the appropriateness of criminal sanctions in primary legislation should be undertaken on an England and Wales basis and should not be dealt with piecemeal.</p><p>
            
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_143gc' title='Col. 143GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 February 2004 vol 658 c143GC' name='column_143gc' href='#column_143gc' rel='bookmark'>143GC</a>
            Section 49 of the <a href="/acts/audit-commission-act-1998">Audit Commission Act</a> is one of a large number of statutory bars to the release of information that is being reviewed at present by the Department for Constitutional Affairs under the <a href="/acts/freedom-of-information-act-2000">Freedom of Information Act 2000</a>. My understanding is that the recommendations of that review are likely to be published in the autumn and implementation of the recommendations would be likely to begin next year.</p><p>
            I have listened very carefully to the strength of feeling expressed by noble Lords both today and, as has been indicated, on Second Reading. I remain of the view that consistency in the application of the criminal sanctions is the key issue. However, I shall give further consideration to the matter within the context of the review to which I alluded and report back to the House.

            If I may, I shall respond first. The Minister said that this is no new bar. It is a discredited bar. It is discredited in Wales. It is for that reason that this section has been condemned by the Welsh Grand Committee, the Welsh Affairs Committee, the Auditor General himself and, most importantly, by the National Assembly. I refer specifically to local authority in Wales. We have had our problems. A bar of this kind cannot remain any longer. I should like to quote what was said by the Assembly Member from Montgomeryshire, Mick Bates, in the debates in the National Assembly. He said:
            <q>Deleting Clause 54 will enhance our ability to govern in the sunshine rather than in the shade".</q>
            In Wales, in certain local government areas, there has been far too much shade.</p><p>
            We will maintain our opposition to this clause throughout these proceedings. While we thank the Minister for his generous words at the end, we hope that that will be very productive at Report stage.

            We sympathise with the Minister for trying to defend the indefensible. Had he not concluded with the words that he did, we should be leaving this Grand Committee with a rather unpleasant end to our debate. The Minister said that he will report back to the House and I hope that he will do so at Report stage. We shall certainly want to debate this again then.</p><p>
            There is probably little more that we can do today. We are quite prepared to leave a difference between England and Wales. However, if the Government want to find a way of removing England from this ludicrous provision, we would fully support them. This provision does not sit alongside a proper audit regime for today. As far as I am aware, the Government have no support from anywhere for so doing. For today, however, we will not press the issue.

        The noble Lord said: I am moving Amendment No. 56 and speaking to the other government amendments in this group on behalf of my noble friend. These are minor and technical amendments, which address a point identified by this House's Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform, although it was not noted in its report. As originally drafted, the clause contained unnecessary references to order and regulation-making powers conferred on the Secretary of State in respect of Part 2 of the Bill. Part 2 comprises provisions relating to local government in Wales and does not confer any order or regulation-making power on the Secretary of State. The amendments are intended to clarify that position. I beg to move.

            I have just one question for the Minister, on taking the Secretary of State out of this part of the Bill. It relates to Clause 16, which sets up the audit code of practice, which will still be subject to an annulment by either House. We debated that matter on our first Committee day, when the Minister said:

        The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 59, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 60, which is grouped with it. Both amendments concern the audit regime for NHS bodies in Wales and add new clauses to the Bill.

        The scheme of the Bill is to mimic the existing English local authority audit provisions for Wales, albeit under the control of the Auditor General rather
        
        <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_145gc' title='Col. 145GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 February 2004 vol 658 c145GC' name='column_145gc' href='#column_145gc' rel='bookmark'>145GC</a>
        than the Audit Commission. But for health bodies the new regime is to give audit responsibility more fully to the Auditor General and not to mimic the existing arrangements. We have no problem with that.

        However, in achieving that, the purpose of the amendments is to question whether the baby has been thrown out with the bath water. Under the existing audit regime there are provisions which allow the health body auditor to act if he believes that unlawful expenditure is about to be incurred; and the auditor can carry out extraordinary audits if he thinks that something needs to be looked at. The Secretary of State can also call for an extraordinary audit. These provisions allow the auditor to act outside the cycle of the annual financial audit and he can stop problems before they get out of hand. They are useful provisions to be held in reserve but they do not feature in the Bill for health bodies, so we are setting up differences, not only between England and Wales&#x2014;the Minister might like to note that&#x2014;but between health bodies and local authority bodies in Wales.

        Therefore, Amendment No. 59 is a version of Section 19 of the <a href="/acts/audit-commission-act-1998">Audit Commission Act</a> and Amendment No. 60 is a version of Section 25 of that Act. There are equivalent provisions for local government in Clauses 33 and 37 of the Bill. My amendments would restore the current position for health bodies. I beg to move.

            We do not consider that Amendment No. 59 is necessary, but I shall give, I hope, significant reasons for making that bold statement. Clause 60 gives the Auditor General statutory responsibility for the financial audit of Welsh National Health Service bodies. His statutory responsibility would be the same as it now is for the National Assembly and its sponsored bodies. The audit process that applies would also be the same.</p><p>
            An item of unlawful expenditure would result in a qualification to an NHS body's accounts, as it does now to the other bodies for which the Auditor General has statutory audit responsibilities. He would publish a report in respect of the qualification and lay the report before the National Assembly. In accordance with its standing orders the National Assembly Audit Committee would meet to consider the qualification. In doing so it would take evidence from relevant officials with financial accountability responsibilities. The committee would issue a report with its conclusions and recommendations to which the Assembly government, in liaison with the NHS body concerned, would be required to respond within a set timescale&#x2014;currently 30 days.</p><p>
            Any potential unlawful expenditure or unlawful decision would as a matter of course be brought to the attention of the NHS body's accounting officer and the National Assembly's accounting officer for the National Health Service in Wales.</p><p>
            Amendment No. 60 is also unnecessary, because the Bill gives the Auditor General statutory responsibility for the financial audit of Welsh National Health Service bodies. As such, he could have access to an NHS body at any time. I heard what the noble Baroness said&#x2014;that the
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_146gc' title='Col. 146GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 February 2004 vol 658 c146GC' name='column_146gc' href='#column_146gc' rel='bookmark'>146GC</a>
            problem was that he might be constrained. But he would have access to an NHS body at any time for the purpose of undertaking a financial audit or an economy, efficiency and effectiveness examination. If his audit or examination resulted in his having concerns over financial accountability or value for money issues, it would be open to the Auditor General to publish a public interest report under new Section 96A of the <a href="/acts/government-of-wales-act-1998">Government of Wales Act 1998</a>, as provided for in Clause 2 of this Bill. He could lay a copy of the report before the National Assembly.</p><p>
            The Assembly Audit Committee proceedings I described with regard to Amendment No. 59 would then be followed. The proposal that the National Assembly should have the power to require that the Auditor General undertake an extraordinary audit would not he consistent with the convention that the National Assembly should not have the power to require the Auditor General to do anything, or indeed to refrain from doing anything, in respect of bodies for which he is the statutory auditor and for which the Assembly has funding responsibilities. This convention is a cornerstone of the Auditor General's statutory independence. It is on that basis that I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

            I am grateful for the Minister's response, and I shall carefully consider what he has said.</p><p>
            The purpose of Amendment No. 59 was to avoid the possibility of having to rely on the ex-post nature of a financial audit&#x2014;the qualification of a set of accounts many months after the end of the financial year, which could put about 18 months between an unlawful act and a report. That is too long.</p><p>
            I shall consider carefully what the Minister said about Clause 2, and whether that creates a sufficient platform for the Auditor General on which to work. I shall also consider carefully the Minister's comments about whether the Auditor General's independence would be impaired by the Assembly being able to require him to carry out an extraordinary audit within the terms of my Amendment No. 60. I am not convinced that that impact impairs the independence, because there are other requirements in the Bill which allow the Assembly to require certain matters to take place&#x2014;for example, in relation to local authorities, which we have been debating for most of the afternoon. While I thank the Minister for his reply, I am not 100 per cent convinced that his reply deals with the points that I raised. However, I shall consider the matter carefully between now and Report stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

        The purpose of the amendment is to discover how long the current appointments of auditors of local authorities under the <a href="/acts/audit-commission-act-1998">Audit Commission Act</a> will run before new appointments are made under Section 13. I understand that some appointments run until 2007.

        Amendment No. 62 is a mirror amendment dealing with the appointment of NHS auditors under Clause 68. Here, the concern is even greater, given the apparent desire to move more wholeheartedly into a new model for the audit of NHS bodies in Wales under the Bill. I beg to move.

            The noble Baroness is right to look at transitional arrangements to see how long they are meant to obtain and to consider their impact. Clauses 67 and 68 make provision for arrangements made by the Audit Commission for the appointment of auditors for local government bodies and NHS bodies in Wales to remain in force when the <a href="/bills/public-audit-wales-bill">Public Audit (Wales) Bill</a> comes into force. They would continue in force until the terms of appointment expired. With regard to the crucial question which the noble Baroness addressed to me, the current framework contracts extend to 2007 and would end then.
