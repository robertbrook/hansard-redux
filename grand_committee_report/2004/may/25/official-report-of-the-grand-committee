        <q>( ) The power to make regulations under subsection (2) having effect in Northern Ireland is exercisable by statutory rule for the purposes of the Statutory Rules (Northern Ireland) Order 1979 (S.I. 1979/1573 (N.I. 12)) and subsections (3) and (4) do not apply to such regulations.</q>

        The noble Baroness said: I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 65R to Clause 172, which would have made a technical change to the kind of process by which regulations for Northern Ireland will be made to give effect to Clause 172. This is to allow further consideration to be given to the kind of legislative format of any regulations made for Northern Ireland under the clause. This consideration does not extend to the level of parliamentary scrutiny. It is still intended that these regulations will be subject to the negative resolution procedure. If necessary, any amending provision to prescribe technical processes specifically for Northern Ireland will be tabled on Report.

            It is extraordinary to withdraw an amendment before it has even been moved. Either an amendment is moved or it is not moved. However, on this occasion, the noble Baroness has decided to withdraw the amendment. I presume, therefore, that the amendment has been moved, but that it has not been discussed. She now wants to withdraw it.

        The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 65U, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 65V through to 65AB. The amendments relate to the power under Clause 182(2) to make orders. It may be helpful to the Committee if I set out briefly the background.

        Part 6 deals with relationships arising through civil partnerships. Clause 181 provides that references to step relations and to in-laws in certain legislation are to be read as including relationships arising through civil partnership. Clause 182 identifies the legislation to which those interpretation rules apply. In particular, they will apply to an existing Act of Parliament or of the Scottish Parliament if it is listed in Schedule 15, and Clause 182(2)(a) confers a power by order to amend the list in Schedule 15. The rules in Clause 181 will also apply to existing subordinate legislation, if it is specified by order, and the power to make such orders is given by Clause 181(2)(b).

        The amendments serve three purposes. First, Amendments Nos. 65U, 65Y and 65AA provide that the power in Clause 182(2) is to be exercisable by a Minister of the Crown, rather than the Secretary of State. That is the standard approach adopted in the Bill and will ensure that Ministers who are not Secretaries of State can make any orders that may be needed in relation to legislation for which they are responsible.

        Secondly, Amendment No. 65V ensures that the power conferred by Clause 182 is extended to the National Assembly for Wales in respect of the interpretation of existing subordinate legislation which it has made or which falls within its competence. Thirdly, Amendment No. 65V ensures that the power in Clause 182(2) is extended to Northern Ireland departments. It is to ensure
        <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_454gc' title='Col. 454GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 May 2004 vol 661 c454GC' name='column_454gc' href='#column_454gc' rel='bookmark'>454GC</a>
        that Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament relating to transferred matters in Northern Ireland can be made subject to the interpretation rules in Clause 181.

        The other amendments are consequential. Amendments Nos. 65W and 65X specify that the power in Clause 182(2), when exercised by a Northern Ireland department, is exercisable by statutory rule. That is usual in the case of subordinate legislation in Northern Ireland. Amendment No. 65Y is simply a consequential drafting change to subsection (5), which sets out the negative resolution procedure requirement for statutory instruments made by a Minister of the Crown. Amendment No. 65Z provides that a statutory rule made by a Northern Ireland department is subject to the negative resolution procedure for Northern Ireland. Finally, Amendment No. 65AB defines the phrase,
        <q>deals with a transferred matter</q>
        in the new subsection. I beg to move.

        I am astonished at the amount of work that has gone into the Bill and the amount of correspondence that has descended on us since the last sitting. In addition to a massive commentary on the clauses, one has received letters from the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, in the Department for Constitutional Affairs; the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, in the Government Whips' Office; the Women and Equality Unit and the <a href="/bills/civil-partnership-bill">Civil Partnership Bill</a> team; and the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, in the Home Office. In addition, there has been a "Dear colleague" letter from the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, and another from the Home Office addressed to the noble Lord, Lord Alli. I cannot promise that I have assimilated every point made in that correspondence, but no doubt it is intended to be helpful. My only question is whether that voluminous correspondence has been placed in the Library, since some people outside this House may have difficulty comprehending the detail of the legislation.

            Quite a lot of that correspondence is self-inflicted. Those of us in Committee have asked for much of it. When the Ministers respond, it is hardly for us to say, "Oh, there is a wealth of correspondence", because we have been asking for it. Maybe if we ask for less, we will be sent less.

            The amendments are related to the question of how these matters are to be handled, where sex is, as quoted in the clause, a "genuine occupational qualification". It is not clear exactly how that is going to operate. It is not immediately apparent why the introduction of same-sex partnerships could give rise to any particular problem with regard to discrimination in employment. It would be helpful to have a brief explanation of that, as against the situation for married couples. I beg to move.

            May I follow up what my noble friend Lord Higgins said? This is a very complex Bill. It does not help to have it changing its nature like a kaleidoscope every day of the week. The House of Lords has a high reputation for the work that it does, particularly on legislation that has been received from the other place without having been considered there; or at least large parts of it not having been considered there. It is our duty to try to make sense of what comes from there. Not infrequently, the Government then lumber us with a huge number of amendments. I do not think that in my time here I have ever seen such a volume of amendments, such complexity and so many references backwards and forwards.</p><p>
            I am sure that the Minister understands every word of it and that she would not even need to take advice from the officials behind her who, I notice, number seven. That is nearly as many as there are noble Lords here to consider the Bill. Sooner or later, it would serve the Government right if the Committee decided just to let the whole lot go through, just like that, and leave it as the mess that so much legislation is when it is first published. For sure, when it gets to the other place, it will not be properly discussed. It will be timetabled, and it will be a great surprise if they even look at most of it.</p><p>
            I am becoming heartily fed up with this place being taken for granted. The Government throw ill considered, ill digested and badly drafted legislation at us, expecting us to take responsibility for ensuring that when it gets on the statute book it is reasonable legislation. It has gone too far, and it is time that the Government resolved to bring before us a Bill that they intend to take through the House and not a Bill which they intend to amend massively after they have published it.

            may be a greater worry for Members of the Committee. If they look at the forthcoming business, Members of the Committee will see that we have a good few weeks between now and Report in which to consider the amendments.

            I am afraid that I have to disappoint the noble Lord. I cannot give that undertaking, but obviously we shall do our best. The number of officials, to which the noble Lord referred, reflects the number of government departments that are involved in the Bill.</p><p>
            I shall answer the questions put by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, by way of responding to each of the amendments. If I may, I shall consider Amendments Nos. 67 and 68 first and then turn to Amendment No. 66.</p><p>
            The provision of the <a href="/acts/sex-discrimination-act-1975">Sex Discrimination Act 1975</a> that subsection (4) of Clause 184 seeks to amend enables an employer to offer two jobs in his or her employment to a married couple, without falling foul of the requirement not to discriminate on grounds of sex. I suppose that the most common situation would be one in which shared accommodation was intrinsic to the job, such as a couple managing a public house. As the daughter of a publican, that is the one I know best.</p><p>
            All that the clause would do is to extend that exception to a case where the couple to be offered the two jobs are civil partners. That goes with our intention in the Bill to ensure that civil partners are not disadvantaged in comparison with married couples. I can see no good reason why an employer with an opportunity of that kind should be allowed to offer it to a man and woman but unable to make it available to a same-sex couple in a civil partnership for fear of a claim of sex discrimination. As the law stands under the <a href="/acts/sex-discrimination-act-1986">Sex Discrimination Act</a>, an exemption is made for a married couple if there is an issue of tied accommodation with the job. We are saying that we read across from that exception to civil partnership, so that where one reads "married persons" one would insert "civil partners".</p><p>
            I assume that Amendment No. 66 is a probing amendment. It is not clear to me what its intended purpose is, and I am not sure what effect it would have in practice. The subsection that Amendment No. 66 would amend relates to the comparison that must be made, if discrimination on the ground of sex is to be demonstrated. The noble Lord will know that, by definition, such a comparison must be with a person of the opposite sex. Someone who is trying to demonstrate that there has been discrimination on the ground of sex must use opposite sex comparators. Adding the words "or the same sex" would therefore have no effect in this context.</p><p>

            I hope that the noble Lord will be satisfied with that and will withdraw the amendment.

            I want a little clarification from the Minister. Someone might, for example, have a country house but not be there for most of the week. Often, one sees advertisements in <span class="italic">The Lady</span> saying, "Married couple wanted to look after house while owners are in London". Such advertisements specify married couples, because normally the wife is the housekeeper and the husband is the gardener, the DIY man, the mechanic and everything else. In future, will people be unable to advertise in <span class="italic">The Lady</span> to say that they want a married couple for a house?

            The noble Baroness is right: we can see such advertisements each week, should we be looking for them. They are not against the law because there is an exception in the <a href="/acts/sex-discrimination-act-1975">Sex Discrimination Act 1975</a> that allows married couples to be considered for such jobs. I used the public house example, but the noble Baroness is right to say that it could apply to a cook and gardener or a housekeeper and gardener. It is the same thing. As the legislation is drafted, there would be a read-across from the legality of the advertisement in <span class="italic">The Lady</span> saying "married couple" to saying "civil partnership".

        The noble Baroness said: The Sex Discrimination (Northern Ireland) Order 1976 makes it unlawful to discriminate in the field of employment against people on the ground that they are married.

        An exception in the Sex Discrimination (Northern Ireland) Order 1976 permits discrimination where sex is a genuine occupational qualification for a job because it is one of two jobs to be offered to a married couple.

        <span class="member">Lord Higgins</span> moved Amendment No. 69:

        The noble Lord said: The amendment is essentially about timing. The final subsection of the clause states:
        <q>This section applies in relation to contracts of assurance entered into on or after the day on which it comes into force".</q>
        As I understand it, that means that a contract of assurance could come into force, with the Bill's coming into force determining the timing of the matter. However, I would have thought that it ought not to be in advance of a civil partnership having been formed. Therefore, the amendment would be appropriate. It would mean that the civil partnership had to be formed before the clause came into operation. I beg to move.

            I was not sure how wide the noble Lord was going to range on the amendment, but it is clear that he is not opening up the whole issue about insurable interest. The automaticity that spouses have in insurable interest goes across to civil partners in a way that obviously does not apply to two strangers, otherwise we would have the plot of a murder mystery.</p><p>
            In terms of timing, we have such a formulation because there is a risk that Clauses 1 and 155 could be commenced prior to Clause 185, and therefore there would be a disjunction in timing. We will seek to avoid that if we can. Obviously, Clause 185 would in no way prevent persons who had entered into contracts of assurance prior to forming a civil partnership&#x2014;where the insurers had recognised that they had an insurable interest from that contract&#x2014;continuing once they were civil partners. The automaticity follows the commencement of the clause.</p><p>

            Up until the commencement of the clause, people must establish that they have an insurable interest, as they might do if they were siblings, for example. Once the clause is commenced, however, the assumption is automatic. Because there could be a disjunction in timing, the clause is needed.

            I understand the point about disjunction, but am I wrong in thinking that the contract of assurance could come into force after the civil partnership is formed? I am not clear what the Government actually intend. Do they want to say that anyone can have a contract of insurance that is operational after the Bill, and that it will then become a mutual affair, so to speak?

            It will apply at a lower level than that. At the moment, a contract of assurance can be used to protect a joint mortgage if you can establish to the satisfaction of the insurance company that you have a legitimate insurable interest in each other's life. Such a contract could be between siblings, between flatmates or two people living as though they were in a civil partnership. At the moment, spouses, uniquely, do not have to establish that they have an insurable interest; it is automatically assumed that they do so. Here we are establishing the same level of automatic assumption for civil partners once they have registered.</p><p>
            It may be that a couple of the same sex living together already have a contract of assurance, but to do so they would have had to establish it. In future, they will not have to establish the fact that they have an insurable interest. But because there could be a disjunction of timing, we need this clause. However, I cannot conceive of any problem&#x2014;if I may put it that way&#x2014;that this may pose for anyone.

            Let me try again because I am still not quite clear about this. As I read the provision, it means that this clause would not apply to a contract of assurance which existed before the partnership was formed. However, I understand the Government's intention to be that if someone has a contract of assurance and a civil partnership is then formed, it will be something that is a mutual interest. However, at the moment, an insurance policy taken out before the civil partnership was formed would not have the same degree of mutuality as one taken out afterwards.

            Perhaps it is my ignorance, but I do not understand the use of the word "mutuality" here. All this clause states is:
            <q>Where two people are civil partners, each of them is to be presumed &#x2026; to have an interest".</q>

        The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 69A, I shall speak also to the amendments grouped with it. So far. discussion on the Bill has mainly centred on the creation of the new legal relationship of civil partnerships, their formation and dissolution and some of the legal consequences of forming a civil partnership. From now on, we turn to the issues surrounding social security and their implications. Here the Government's purpose is twofold: to ensure that there is no inequity of treatment&#x2014;

            Having discussed <span class="italic">The Lady,</span> it appears that the best principles governing dinner parties in country houses has been the source of most of our analogies so far.</p><p>
            Our advisers have changed because at this point in the Bill we move to the territory of social security. Two things must be done simultaneously. We must ensure on the one hand that there is equity of treatment between civil partners and married couples while, on the other hand, we must ensure equity and comparability of treatment between cohabiting couples of opposite sexes and cohabiting couples of the same sex for social security purposes. The test used for social security purposes for a cohabiting couple is whether two people are living together as a couple, as husband and wife&#x2014;or the equivalent wording. That sets out the general context in which a whole sequence of amendments have been tabled both on the government side and by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins.</p><p>
            We start, possibly in a slightly back-to-front manner, with a series of amendments needed for Northern Ireland. Since most social security and child support legislation for Northern Ireland stands separate to that passed at Westminster for Great Britain, we need separate amendments to ensure that provisions there mirror what we are providing for Great Britain. Amendments Nos. 69A, 69B, 71A, 71B, 71C, 71D, 7IE and 71F amend Clause 186 to ensure that Northern Ireland departments making an order under Clause 191 may deal with references in existing social security and child support legislation to persons who are living or have lived together as husband and wife. The power under Section 191 will enable Northern Ireland departments to translate such references into a reference to persons who are living, or have lived, together as if they were civil partners.</p><p>
            The insertion of the reference to the Pneumoconiosis, etc., (Workers' Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1979 is to ensure that parallel amendments may be

            made to that order and the 1979 Act of the same name. The Committee may wish to discuss the substance of the issue when we reach the GB provisions, on which the situation is clear, but the Northern Ireland bundle mirrors what we will do with the GB framework. I beg to move.

        The noble Lord said: It would be helpful to discuss Amendment No. 71 also. Truth be told, I am not sure that this grouping is very helpful, as Amendment No. 70 deals with a small, pedantic point, whereas Amendment No. 71 deals with the more important issue of the deletion of subsection (3).

        I shall deal first with Amendment No. 71 and say a word at the end about Amendment No. 70. With almost unintentional humour, the draftsman has described Part 7 of the Bill as "Miscellaneous". We accept that the main purpose of the Bill relates to the controversial issue of civil partnerships and broad issues of equality. However, despite the assertion by the noble Lord, Lord Alli, that the central purpose of the Bill is almost uniquely important and that none of the other matters in the Bill is of the least importance, this part contains a series of sections concerned with social security, child support and tax credits. It would be helpful to pick up each issue separately as we come to the related amendments.

        It remains unclear why the position on tax as against social security should be treated as it has been. We received a press release&#x2014;nowadays even the gravest issues can be dealt with by press releases, certainly by Inland Revenue ones&#x2014;that said that the <a href="/bills/civil-partnership-bill">Civil Partnership Bill</a> was social security legislation, so any tax consequences would be dealt with in the next available finance Bill. We have failed to get from the Government Front Bench any answer on what that expression means or when the next available finance Bill is likely to contain the legislation that has such an important bearing on this Bill

        The other strange aspect is that the press release states:
        <q>The clauses giving effect to the changes have been included in the <a href="/bills/civil-partnership-bill">Civil Partnership Bill</a>"&#x2014;</q>
        so far as concerns tax credits and so on&#x2014;

        The Government seem to want to have their cake and eat it. I am unclear why the Bill deals, for example, with tax credits, an area taken over effectively in an empire-building exercise by the Chancellor. At all events, it does not seem a satisfactory arrangement, when so much of what is important in the Bill turns out not to be in it at all. More particularly&#x2014;and this brings

        me to the amendment&#x2014;so much will be dealt with by powers to make subordinate legislation. The subsection states that the,
        <q>power under section 191 to make orders amending enactments and subordinate legislation is to be treated as including power to amend the provision to refer to persons who are living or have lived together".</q>

        The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, and I have discussed these matters many times and over a range of Bills over many years. She has always been extremely helpful in letting us have draft orders before we come to the more substantive parts of the Bill. I hope she will find it possible to do that on the various matters that we are now going to discuss, which are dealt with simply by taking powers to implement the legislation by subordinate legislation. I hope that she will make it possible to have those draft orders before we get to Report. She has been extremely helpful in that respect in the past, and one must hope that that is so in future.

        At all events, Amendment No. 71 suggests that to take powers in this area&#x2014;in a great many areas of social security, the Child Support Agency and so on&#x2014;is not a desirable way in which to proceed, when such an incredible amount of detail on other matters of relatively small importance is spelt out almost <span class="italic">ad infinitum</span> in the Bill.

        Amendment No. 70 would leave out subsection (2)(b), which contains a rather extraordinary expression. It refers to legislation that,
        <q>contains references (however expressed) to persons who are living or have lived together as husband and wife".</q>

        I cannot recall ever seeing in legislation before the expression "however expressed", which seems remarkably wide-ranging. Perhaps the draftsman finally cracked up at this stage and thought that this was the easiest way out. Will the Minister tell us why the parenthesis is necessary? I beg to move.

            I hesitate to intervene in what I suspect will be a series of conversations between the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham. However, I wonder whether the Minister will answer a question for me which is of concern in this area.</p><p>
            This part of the legislation allows a test for same-sex couples, so that a number of people living in same-sex couples who claim individual status will lose that status and be treated by the social security system in the same way as unmarried couples. Ironically, this is one of those areas that the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, if she were in her place, would understand. It follows the agenda of rights and responsibilities and some of the penalties that go along with equalisation in this area.</p><p>
            I have one specific worry. Through the social security system, there is a danger that a lot of gay couples who currently keep their relationship secret because of fear of prejudice may be outed by various departments which seek, rightly, to implement the regulations but, in doing so, expose relationships that

            many people are not confident of exposing. Will the Minister tell me more about what other departments might do to help in those situations, because that is a worry and concern to many people in the gay community?

            The push of the amendments as drafted is to exclude cohabiting same-sex couples from falling within the remit of certain aspects of social security, although I know from what he has said that that is not the noble Lord's intent. That is what his amendments technically do hut, as it was not the argument that he advanced, I shall not go down that path, despite the fact that I have a speech written to that effect. I am sure that he will be rather pleased.</p><p>
            The noble Lord went on to a second point, which was a legitimate query about the power taken by the Bill to amend regulations subsequently. We are trying throughout the Bill&#x2014;I am not saying that we have got it perfect&#x2014;when there is primary legislation that needs amendment, to amend that legislation in the Bill or by schedule. As the noble Lord will know, an awful lot of social security legislation is tucked away in regulations. Therefore, we are seeking to take a power to amend those regulations accordingly, otherwise we shall absolutely clutter up legislation.</p><p>
            If we were to redraft all regulations so that wherever it said "married couples" they also referred to "civil partners" and where it said "cohabiting couples" or "lived together as husband and wife", we had to express whether the couple were of the opposite or same sex, we would end up with a Bill that was several sizes larger than this one. Therefore, it makes greater sense, because we all know that the import is to get a read-across from married status to civil partnership and cohabiting opposite-sex couples to cohabiting same-sex couples, to do that in secondary legislation, as for the most part that simply means adding in a couple of words to adjust the terminology. It makes sense to do that by regulation and not to clutter up the Bill.</p><p>
            The noble Lord also pushed us on the phrase "however expressed". There have been various ways in which to express both opposite-sex cohabitation as well as same-sex cohabitation, so it is a way in which to have an inclusive terminology.</p><p>
            I am very happy that my noble friend Lord Alli raised a substantive point, to which we may wish to return. He referred to the worry that by expanding social security reach to include, for the first time, people living as same-sex couples who have hitherto been treated as individuals, we would turn the clock back to the treatment of cohabiting opposite-sex couples, which many of them experienced in the 1950s. I am thinking of prurience, twitching net curtains, anonymous telephone calls and the like.</p><p>
            It was precisely because I shared those concerns, and because representations had been made to me by friends and colleagues such as my noble friend Lord Alli, that I have had two seminars with relevant organisations, including Stonewall, the Social Security Advisory Committee, the Lesbian and Gay Lawyers
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_466gc' title='Col. 466GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 May 2004 vol 661 c466GC' name='column_466gc' href='#column_466gc' rel='bookmark'>466GC</a>
            Association, the Local Government Association and the CAB. We considered whether the existing test for living together as husband and wife for cohabiting unmarried opposite-sex couples was still appropriate in its language and, if so, whether it could he applied to same-sex relationships. What we came up with as a result was a need to readdress that test across the board.</p><p>
            We found the discussion very helpful&#x2014;it is going very well&#x2014;and we are getting a new framework in which we can train our staff to act appropriately, sensitively, discreetly but even-handedly with opposite sex and same-sex couples in future. We are working on the matter, and I hope to have drafts that I can put in the Library and circulate to people as they wish during the summer.</p><p>
            Alongside that process&#x2014;this has been put to us emphatically&#x2014;we need to ensure that our staff are trained, both those of heterosexual and those of same-sex orientation. Some staff are worried that they may be outed against their wish, on the ground that they have "special skills" or "special insights". The issue is delicate. I have spoken to staff about the problems, and I am seeking the aid of the organisations to help us to go through the modules of sexual orientation training and role-play, where appropriate. We went through similar exercises when we introduced the disability legislation, to increase sensitivity.</p><p>
            I hope that the Committee will forgive this slightly extended discussion. I assure the noble Lord that with the help of the organisations, to which I pay tribute, we shall not only produce a sensitive test for same-sex couples but greatly improve the test for cohabiting couples. I hope that, with that extended description, which rather got away from the original point of the amendments, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

            Although we understand that some of the orders made under the clause and related clauses may simply be of, in effect, a drafting nature, clearly some of them will not be. They are very wide powers in relation to a whole range of matters&#x2014;social security, child support, tax credits, occupational pensions and so on. Is the noble Baroness able to provide draft regulations of a substantive as against a purely drafting nature? I very much hope that she is.

            No. I am advised that we are at a disadvantage because the Bill started in this House. Normally, on social security legislation, we have been able to provide draft regulations for us to consider while a Bill was in Committee and on Report. That has usually been because the Bill has started in the other House, so the time of parliamentary counsel has been available to move from primary legislation to the draft regulations. So, I cannot do what the noble Lord asks.</p><p>
            I shall see whether we can expand on the explanatory memorandum that went to the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform, if the noble Lord feels unsure about the reach of the Bill. If he would like to indicate any area, over

            and beyond what we have done for that committee, I shall be very happy to ask our officials to expand on the regulations.</p><p>
            Part of the matter is the need to have what I call a fishing-trip clause. For example, with Schedule 17 and related clauses, we think that we have to the best of our ability caught most of the appropriate legislation. However, I asked yesterday whether we had considered a situation where someone may be liable who applied for a social fund payment to help with funeral costs for someone on income support. The person liable is normally next of kin. Have we covered civil partnerships under "next of kin"? We do not know. I need to check that.</p><p>
            In such a situation, we do not yet know that we have caught every piece of legislation and their associated regulations. That is why we need the general power, otherwise I would be troubling noble Lords with not only a very long Bill, but repeated occasions on the Floor of the House simply to add "or civil partners" in regulations after regulations.</p><p>
            If, following the noble Lord's scouring of the Delegated Powers Committee's explanatory memorandum, he would like the officials to enlarge on any substantive point, I would be happy to arrange that. However, I cannot give him the draft regulations now. It is too early.

            I am grateful to the noble Baroness, but it is a considerable disadvantage if, every time that a Bill starts in the House of Lords, the draftsman has not yet drafted the regulations. Perhaps we need to consider the point further.</p><p>
            My primary concern is that the powers may be used to affect various interests. For example, the Bill contains considerable proposals for occupational pensions, in which we may be granting order-making powers that would affect private interests involved. I will need to consider to what extent the powers should be rather more confined and restricted than they appear to be in some cases at the moment. We shall return to the matter on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

        The noble Lord said: The amendment is self-explanatory. On many previous pieces of social security legislation we have found that the Social Security Advisory Committee has been almost completely ignored or not consulted at all; on other occasions it has produced advice of help to the House. I am not sure what is the situation in relation to this legislation. No doubt the noble Baroness will tell us whether the committee has been consulted and, if so, with what result.

            The amendments would require us to consult the Social Security Advisory Committee. The noble Lord will understand that I cannot accept the amendments for the following reasons. First, the Social Security Advisory Committee is not consulted about regulations that are laid within six months of the primary legislation because it is assumed that the halo effect of parliamentary scrutiny will continue, as will be the case here. Secondly, the committee's formal remit does not extend to some areas covered by the Bill: for example, Inland Revenue tax credits&#x2014;an issue about which the noble Lord has been concerned in the past&#x2014;the Child Support Agency and occupational pensions. So there cannot be the blanket coverage sought in the amendment.</p><p>
            The third reason, which I hope will give the noble Lord a little more satisfaction, is that there is already good, informal consultation between the Social Security Advisory Committee, the Inland Revenue and ourselves, and a memorandum of understanding is being drawn up to that effect. The noble Lord asked me for an assurance about whether the Social Security Advisory Committee was consulted. We wrote to the committee about this matter and, in its letter of 19 May, the Social Security Advisory Committee replied that,
            <q>no particular concerns have been expressed about those matters that fall within the Committee's statutory remit".</q>
            So I checked whether the Social Security Advisory Committee had any concerns, and it has made it clear that, as of four or five days ago, it has not.</p><p>
            It has made active and valuable evaluations of the "living together" test and some of the detailed informal consultation underpinning the Bill. With those assurances, I hope the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

            That was a more convincing reply than I have received on other occasions. I am grateful. However, it raises the question of whether the powers of the committee should be extended to cover the issues specified by the noble Baroness. It also raises the question of whether the six-month limit on the Social Security Advisory Committee being allowed to comment on orders laid within that time is as appropriate as it might be&#x2014;-not least because they will be drafted within six months but no attempt has been made to draft them so far.</p><p>
            At all events, I am glad to hear that the committee has been consulted, even though it has nothing very helpful to say. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

        The noble Lord said: As I said earlier, the Bill affects a great many areas of social security, including occupational pensions, state pensions, public service pensions, tax credits and so on, and the <a href="/acts/child-support-act-1991">Child Support Act 1991</a>. By leaving out the sub-paragraphs referred to in the amendment, in effect, the powers of inspection in relation to the <a href="/acts/child-support-act-1991">Child Support Act 1991</a> would be removed. However, it would be helpful to have a wider debate on the position of the Child Support Agency because I am not absolutely clear how it will operate in the context of the Bill.

        Obviously the basic legislation is concerned with couples who are married or in a relationship where a child is produced. The question is whether the parent who does not have care should make some contribution towards the support of the individual child.

        I am not quite clear why the Child Support Agency is relevant in that context. Are we saying that if a same-sex couple adopts a child and the relationship either breaks up or one or other of the same-sex partners does not help to finance the child, the Child Support Agency and the powers specified under the schedule will become operative?

        We well know that the situation of the Child Support Agency generally has been very unsatisfactory, albeit that the agency was introduced originally by a Conservative government. The present Government sought to change the formula so that from April 2002 the system would go live for new cases only, resulting in a situation where absent parents would pay 50 per cent of their net income for one child, 20 per cent for two and 30 per cent for three or more.

        This has been appallingly slow in coming into effect. Time and time again, Parliamentary Questions are put to Ministers, asking when the conversion of the system is to take place; and time and time again the matter has been delayed. So on top of what is already, to say the

        I am appalled that the amount of compensation paid by the Child Support Agency for maladministration in the past five years is more than &#x00A3;12 million. The whole system is under enormous strain, as the noble Baroness will recognise. She personally has done all that she can to try to put the matter right, but to put this further strain on it at this stage is unwise, even if one understands&#x2014;as I do not&#x2014;exactly what it is that the Child Support Agency is supposed to do in the context of the Bill.

            I am at a slight disadvantage because the noble Lord's speech is, to some degree, at odds with the tabled amendment. His amendment would jeopardise the position of compellable witnesses. At the moment, in law, spouses are not compelled to incriminate themselves and give evidence against their partners. We are extending that same right of immunity to civil partners.</p><p>
            The noble Lord's amendment would extract from the Bill the right of immunity not to be a compellable witness for a civil partner. That is what the amendments would do and that is what my speech is about&#x2014;but that is not, of course, what the noble Lord has been talking about. I do not think he mentioned the words "compellable witness" at any stage, even though his amendment would affect such people.</p><p>
            He spoke to the more general point about why the Child Support Agency has anything to do with the Bill. He was right to focus on adoption. Some partners, he they same-sex male or same-sex female, and same-sex couples whether or not they are civil partners, may well bring children into a relationship from a previous relationship. In the case of a same-sex female couple, the biological father of the child, or otherwise the biological mother if she remains the non-resident parent, will be liable for support from the Child Support Agency.</p><p>
            A child may also be adopted within the relationship or a child may be produced through artificial insemination. I understand that 100 or 125 same-sex female couples undergo the procedure every year. Finally, the child may have become the child of the family for other reasons. For example, the natural father of the child of a same-sex female couple may have died.</p><p>
            In all those cases, where there would be a presumption of continued child support as in marriage, that will be the case for civil partners, and where there would be a presumption for cohabiting partners, that will be the case for same-sex couples. The Bill establishes the same responsibilities for children, whether those children are adopted, children of the relationship or a child of the family, as currently exist for opposite-sex couples.</p><p>

            The noble Lord finally made some general points about the Child Support Agency. Like the noble Lord, I wish that the information technology and computer systems had been able to move ahead faster, but we should not underestimate the fact that we have already put through something in the order of 150,000 cases under the new system. I believe that as of a few days ago, the child maintenance premium has gone to around 20,000 families. So we are getting there, perhaps a little more slowly than one would wish, but when we are assured that the new system is sufficiently robust so that we can bring existing cases held under the old system across to the new one, we shall be able to direct money to children more quickly, more transparently and with more consent.</p><p>
            With those remarks, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment regarding compellable witnesses.

            The noble Baroness said that this is intended to extend to civil partners the present exemption from liability of a spouse to be a compellable witness against the other side. She made those remarks in the context of child support arrangements. However, I rather assume that she has referred to a general principle here, which is one that we would certainly support. However, I wonder where it appears in the Bill. Having had only a quick look, I have not found it. Perhaps I have overlooked the provision, or is it intended that it should be dealt with by order? If not, where is it set out? It is certainly something that should be in the Bill.

            I shall take advice on that. However, the noble Lord is absolutely right. This is a general power derived from social security legislation passed in 1986, 1989 and 1992 regarding compellable witnesses. In this Bill we are extending those provisions across the board, but the first point at which the matter arises is with regard to the Child Support Agency, as the noble Lord realises. However, I am about to be told where this is set out in the Bill.

            I share the implicit concern expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that this may go rather wider than we had thought. However, as I now understand the precise purpose of this provision&#x2014;which seeks to amend Section 15 of the <a href="/acts/child-support-act-1991">Child Support Act 1991</a> covering the powers of inspectors&#x2014;in that context, inspectors may find themselves in a situation where either one member of a married couple or one partner of a civil partnership refuses to respond to him, by analogy with the situation of a wife not being able to give evidence against her husband. That will place a severe restriction on the ability of the inspectors to find out what is really happening. However, no doubt we would create a difficult legal precedent if we went against it. I am not clear why the power has to be included. I want to consider carefully what the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said and I shall do so in the light of the Minister's comments. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

        The noble Lord said: The drafting again seems slightly unusual because, as pointed out by the noble Baroness, an enormous amount of what I am almost inclined to say is legislative garbage is made by reference back and forth, from statutory instrument to primary legislation and back again. In the absence of consolidation, it is tremendously difficult for anyone to follow the trail to its conclusion.

        To include "as originally enacted" seems very strange. Perhaps I am mistaken and it has been used before. It means that, instead of looking at a particular Act of long ago that might have been altered three or four times and then again by statutory instrument, one has to go back to the beginning&#x2014;before it was altered&#x2014;to find its meaning. Perhaps the noble Baroness will clarify the situation. I beg to move.

            I shall do my best to help. I agree with the noble Lord; the phrase is unusually colloquial for a Bill. It refers to the <a href="/acts/child-support-act-1991">Child Support Act 1991</a>. The new system was introduced by amendments to that Act, not by a new, free-standing Act that replaced the old one. The phrase simply refers to arrangements under the old scheme as opposed to the new one. Under the old scheme, the partner of the non-resident parent might need to have his or her income assessed to determine the level of household income necessary for the children in the second family. That does not come into play under the new scheme so we need to distinguish between the old and new schemes in the wording. With that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.

            The scheme is not perpetuated indefinitely but while the old scheme continues we need the power. When the old scheme folds in the sense that existing clients of the agency will go across to the new scheme, the power will obviously not be needed. The income of the second adult in the non-resident parent's family would not be taken into account because we would not need to assess it.

        The noble Lord said: The amendment seeks to leave out paragraph 4 which would insert after paragraph 6(5) of the schedule&#x2014;dare I say it?&#x2014;as originally enacted, a new sub-paragraph (5A) which states:
        <q>For the purposes of this paragraph, two adults of the same sex arc to he regarded as living together"&#x2014;</q>
        as civil partners and as if they were two adults of the opposite sex. It is effectively a cohabitation argument, if I understand it correctly. The cohabitation provisions will effectively appertain to determining to what extent people on the old scheme are parents with care. That is as opposed to those subject to the new scheme; we are not clear at all what happens under that.

            I would happily spend half an hour discussing the new arrangements for child support, but I am not sure that the rest of the Committee would be very happy with that. A self-denying ordinance will prevail, so I shall not.</p><p>
            I merely say that, under the new scheme, the only income assessment made is of the non-resident parent's wage or salary, as against the number of children in the first and possibly the second family. If there is one child in the family that he is needed to support, he pays 15 per cent; if there are two, he pays 20 per cent; and if there are three or more, he pays 25 per cent. That is the only calculation that needs to be made. It takes about eight lines of financial calculation, compared to 39 lines of it under the old scheme.</p><p>
            Under the old scheme, because minimum income levels are determined by the capacity of the second family to support its children before money goes to the first family that the non-resident parent is obliged to support, one has to determine the income of the
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_474gc' title='Col. 474GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 May 2004 vol 661 c474GC' name='column_474gc' href='#column_474gc' rel='bookmark'>474GC</a>
            partner of the non-resident parent to see whether that second family has sufficient income. We have quite rightly stripped all that out of the new system. While the old system exists, it is important to establish parity&#x2014;fairness&#x2014;between different groups of people.</p><p>
            The amendment would do something that I am sure that the noble Lord does not intend. It would recognise civil partners for husband-and-wife purposes&#x2014;for assessing joint financial income in terms of a conventional spouse as the non-resident parent. It would also recognise cohabiting opposite-sex couples, as now, but not cohabiting same-sex couples. Those are what we need to bring into the equation. For reasons that escape me, the noble Lord seeks to exclude those by his amendment. I am sure that, on reflection, he will want them included. On that basis, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

        The noble Lord said: The matter is again very complex. The amendment is concerned with social security contributions and the definition of a surviving civil partner. That raises the question of survivors' pensions and, perhaps to some extent, contributions. I think, but am far from certain, that the clause seeks to define a surviving civil partner. Apparently, the provision would apply only in the case of women. I presume that that in turn refers to the complexity of existing legislation, whereby only a woman gains from the existing contribution. I am reassured by the noble Baroness's nod. Apparently that anomaly will be perpetuated here, although I presume that it will persist only until a certain date rather than indefinitely. Perhaps the noble Baroness could confirm whether that is so.

            Many of the points that the noble Lord made are relevant to the bigger amendment, Amendment No. 77, which he did not move, rather than the smaller one, Amendment No. 78. As he was using the amendment to open up a general question, I shall seek to answer it.</p><p>
            The noble Lord is entirely right. At present, widows may enjoy survivors' benefits from 1978 and widowers from 1988. Women are also entitled to a dependency pension based on National Insurance contributions, whereas men may not enjoy such a pension until 2010, when the ages will start to equalise. Widowers'
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_476gc' title='Col. 476GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 May 2004 vol 661 c476GC' name='column_476gc' href='#column_476gc' rel='bookmark'>476GC</a>
            retirement age is five years later than that of widows, so a double transition is happening. There is both the right of men to draw a pension from their partner's national insurance contributions in the same way as women can, and, secondly, we have the disparate ages of retirement: 60 until 2010 for women, increasing by one year every two years until 2020. The noble Lord is therefore right on both those counts. It is a finite problem. As and when the pension age is equalised, the treatment of widows and widowers will be equalised in the same way. I hope that that answers the noble Lord's points.</p><p>
            I could go on to the technical detail of his amendments, but I think that he was using them as a peg for the wider assurances.

        The noble Lord said: This part of the Bill is concerned with contributions and the use of former spouses' contributions. It may be helpful to take the two together. As I understand it, there will be discussion generally of these matters as far as the contributions issue is concerned.

            On the noble Lord's question whether it mirrors the situation of married couples, he is absolutely right. At the moment, a married woman but not a married man can use her husband's national insurance contributions to draw a category B pension, or a dependency or a 60 per cent pension from him. From 2010, so will men be able to draw a similar pension from women if. for example, the man was at home and she was in work and she had acquired the better run of national insurance contributions. The amendments remove the right of civil partners to enjoy the same access to category B pensions as currently exists. There is a complexity because at the moment a woman derives a pension from a man.</p><p>
            Therefore, if we were to get an exact mirror, male same-sex couples would be able to draw pensions now, whereas female same-sex couples&#x2014;because a female

            could not draw a pension from another female, because a man cannot draw a pension from a female&#x2014;would not. You get the bizarre result that male same-sex couples would be drawing a dependency pension ahead of female same-sex couples. That is why I equivocated a little, but the attempt is to replicate the existing situation with regard to married couples. We had to decide whether to replicate exactly. or try to get the fairness point established. From 2010, in the same way that men draw from women, so will same-sex couples be able to draw, subject to the retirement age, which is gender-based, not marriage or spousal relationship-based. I hope that that clarifies the situation.

            That is not the view of some of the outside interests. There are some serious anomalies here with regard to the situation of same-sex couples gaining from the contributions situation.

            A dependent's pension. I am not clear&#x2014;and this is relevant to what we have been discussing&#x2014;to what extent the contribution of one or other of the partners will be relevant. Are we to understand that the larger contribution of the two presumed contributions of the individuals concerned will be the basis for the pension? Underlying what I am saying is a concern that some other groups, particularly those with deficient contribution records who do not get a national insurance pension now, will continue not to get it because of their deficient record, whereas suddenly those who form a same-sex partnership will find that they do, even though they have a deficient contribution record. That seems unfair. That is what I am concerned about in this section&#x2014;which as the noble Baroness rightly pointed out is about contributions&#x2014;and I wonder whether we are dealing unfairly, because of the existing contribution rules, with regard to specific individuals.</p><p>
            On top of all that, if someone now gets married, he finds that he gets a wife's pension, and he has paid no more in contributions than a single person. The existing system, a relic, as I said at Second Reading, of Beveridge, provides that single people are grossly discriminated against. What worries me here is that we are extending that discrimination. There is yet another group who will get a national Insurance pension while deficient in their contributions, while single people

            continue not to get any benefit, even though they have paid the same amount. At some stage, we need to consider whether it is appropriate to extend these provisions in this way when we have another group that is even more unfairly treated.

            The noble Lord is absolutely right that the state pension is the last unreformed bit of Beveridge. It presumed a society where he worked for a wage, and she was at home and worked bringing up the children, but not for a wage. Therefore, his wage, and subsequently his pension, were regarded as providing for both of them. It was therefore a dependent's pension based on 60 per cent, and only if her own national insurance contributions through work exceeded that would she come best to a calculation. It is still the case that only 14 per cent of women recently retired go into retirement with a full basic state pension in their own right. The rest get it either through their husband or, given that half of all women aged over 65 are widows, through a displacement of national insurance contributions.</p><p>
            There is a wider debate that the noble Lord may wish to have at some stage, but this is not the time for it. By extending to civil partners the rights and responsibilities of marriage, the dependency pension, the category B pension, the 60 per cent pension&#x2014;which currently goes to wives, and will from 2010 be available to men if their wives have a better NI record&#x2014;must be read across to civil partners. That means that single people, or people who have been cohabiting in same-sex or opposite-sex relationships for many years&#x2014;even 20, 30 or 40 years&#x2014;do not derive any entitlement to national insurance. That is where we stand. We are addressing the immediate anomaly by trying to ensure that civil partners enjoy the same structure of social security support and responsibilities as do married couples.</p><p>
            I do not deny that that means that other people do not have those same rights. The noble Lord has identified that. However, that is as far as I can go as this stage. We understand the situation perfectly well, but as this Bill seeks to establish equity or parity of treatment between civil partners and married couples, to civil partners will go the category B dependency pension from an appropriate stage.

            Perhaps the noble Baroness would confirm that in the case of civil partners, as well as spouses, no one can claim both a category A and a category B pension, and that there is no question of one civil partner getting two pensions&#x2014;it is whichever is the better of the two.

            It is certainly the case that you cannot have both a category A and category B pension. Conventionally, a man will have worked and acquired the national insurance contribution, and the wife, not being in waged work, will have acquired the dependency pension. If you have two civil partners, both of whom have worked all their lives, they in their relationship will receive two 100 per cent pensions rather than 160 per cent.</p><p>

            I can quite envisage a situation, for example, where one partner in a lesbian relationship may have brought her children with her. Because she has come out of a marriage with children, she may be deficient in national insurance contributions whereas her new civil partner has a full record. It would therefore make sense for her to get the 60 per cent.</p><p>
            I can also envisage situations where, in the case of a same-sex couple, one may be in regular employment as a teacher and the other may be self-employed as a potter or a craftsperson and not have a full record. They will have a choice as to which is the best buy for them. I would expect that in most civil partnerships the dependency pension will not come into play simply because people will be better off drawing on their own national insurance contributions, but that may not always be the case.

            The other point I was going to make, as the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, quite rightly said, is that this will provide a new opportunity for someone who has a poor contribution record to enter into a civil partnership, with the result that they will then acquire a much better contribution record. But, of course, that is equally the case at present for a woman with no contribution record who marries a man with a full contribution record and thereby acquires a right to the widow's pension.

            This has been a helpful discussion. I am not sure to what extent it was wholly related to the amendments&#x2014;to a considerable extent, I think&#x2014;but we need to be clear about the matter. As the noble Baroness said, this perhaps deals with the last unreformed piece of Beveridge. While there may not be any votes in it, it is a matter that should be borne in mind when we go on, as the Bill does, extending the anomalies in the way suggested.</p><p>

        The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 81A, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 81B. These are two minor amendments to correct the drafting of paragraph 21 of Schedule 17. The paragraph amends Section 51 of the <a href="/acts/social-security-contributions-and-benefits-act-1992">Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992</a> so as to extend entitlement to category B retirement pension from widowers alone to widowers and surviving civil partners.

        Amendment No. 81A seeks to insert the word "retirement" into line one of new subsection (1A). It might be thought unnecessary when using the word "pension" to insert the word "retirement", but I am advised that you have to use the description in the text set out in the original legislation; that contained the word and hence it needs to be reinserted.

        Amendment No. 81B reflects the fact that subparagraph (3) now has effect in relation to deaths occurring after 5 October 2002. The original text of the Act set out the different date of "2000". That has been amended by Section 39 of the <a href="/acts/child-support-pensions-and-social-security-act-2000">Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000</a> to "2002". We need to go back to the exact wording of the home legislation, if I can so regard it. Perhaps we should have picked up on the matter earlier, but we did not. I hope that Members of the Committee will accept these drafting amendments. I beg to move.

            Indeed. The question is: what is the situation regarding tax credits in same-sex partnerships? The subsection suggests,
            <q>for 'married couple or unmarried couple' substitute 'couple&#x2014;'".</q>
            The question of tax credits is important. One can understand the problems caused by complexity in this area. Perhaps I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Alli, in particular that those entering a civil partnership may be wise to consider the effects on them as regards tax credits. They may find that not everything is as good as they might reasonably suppose. In reports in the Sunday papers last weekend, the stringent codes of practice that the Revenue is now adopting were described as "alarming reading". It was reported that steep fines of &#x00A3;3,000 and a further fine of &#x00A3;60 a day may be imposed if one does not complete the forms as accurately as the Revenue wishes.</p><p>
            The whole area of tax credits has become unbelievably complex and difficult. The main problem that arises from this is the question of take-up, which
            
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_489gc' title='Col. 489GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 May 2004 vol 661 c489GC' name='column_489gc' href='#column_489gc' rel='bookmark'>489GC</a>
            is frighteningly low. But the extent to which people are confused is not surprising. Within the space of four years, from 1999 to 2003, the Chancellor abolished family credit and introduced the working families' tax credit, introduced the disabled person's tax credit, introduced the child care tax credit, introduced an employment credit, introduced the children's tax credit, introduced the baby tax credit, abolished the working families' tax credit, abolished the disabled person's tax credit, abolished the children's tax credit, abolished the baby tax credit and introduced the child tax credit. All that is apart from the pensions credit, which itself has considerable problems. It is therefore not surprising that many people are confused about what is going on. How many of these surviving credits, if I may put it that way, will those who form civil partnerships be entitled to receive?</p><p>
            The tax credit renewal form is appallingly complex&#x2014;I would have great difficulty in filling it in. There are real problems here. More particularly, the question arises&#x2014;and it is worthwhile having a fairly general debate at this stage&#x2014;to what extent those entering into a civil partnership will gain as far as tax credits are concerned, and to what extent they will find it not to their advantage to have formed a civil partnership. Perhaps the noble Baroness could enlighten us. I beg to move.

            This is a key issue because more than in most areas of social security, treating same-sex couples&#x2014;whether in civil partnerships or cohabiting&#x2014;as joint households will have significant effects. The amendment is pegged to open up a wider discussion, as the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, seeks. For the purposes of social security, this amendment would treat civil partners, cohabiting same-sex and cohabiting opposite-sex couples as though they were two separate individuals claiming benefit, to their financial gain. The only union left after he removed those is marriage, where they would be treated as a household, to their huge financial detriment. I understand that the noble Lord does not intend that in this probing amendment. He asked what examples I could give.</p><p>
            I will take a "Janet and Jane" rather than a "Janet and John" example. Janet has two children and earns &#x00A3;15,000 a year. Jane has one child and earns &#x00A3;10,000 a year. Treated as separate individuals, as they currently are under the law, they would together but as separate individuals, acquire an additional &#x00A3;8,000 tax credit to top up their incomes of &#x00A3;15,000 and &#x00A3;10,000 respectively. However, were this Janet and John&#x2014;whether married or cohabiting and therefore treated as a couple&#x2014;they would, with the same income and the same number of children, get not &#x00A3;8,000, but &#x00A3;1,800.</p><p>
            We covered this matter at our preliminary discussion. It means that when someone moves from being assessed as a single person for tax credits where children are involved, high-value benefits such as housing benefit&#x2014;although the non-dependent adult deduction comes into play here, which mitigates it somewhat&#x2014;income support, jobseeker's allowance and other income-related benefits, in particular where
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_490gc' title='Col. 490GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 May 2004 vol 661 c490GC' name='column_490gc' href='#column_490gc' rel='bookmark'>490GC</a>
            there are children, to being assessed as a couple, some of the losses can be very considerable. The noble Lord asked me for an example, and that is what I would cite for him.</p><p>
            We will do our best to ensure that all couples, whether of the same sex or of the opposite sex, let alone civil partners, understand the implications of how social security legislation will affect them once this Bill comes into force in a year or so. Equally, we will seek to avoid asking for repayments from someone who has inadvertently made a mistake and failed to appreciate that, although they have not entered into a civil partnership, nonetheless they are affected because they now form a same-sex couple. The test for that refers back to an earlier discussion: whether people are living together as husband and wife as revised under our new proposals in conjunction with the organisations to which I referred.</p><p>
            However, I do not think that we can duck the issue that if we are seeking to establish parity between civil partners and married couples, there should also be parity between same-sex cohabiting couples and opposite-sex cohabiting couples. The noble Lord asked me to clarify the situation, and I have set out exactly what will happen.</p><p>
            The amendment tabled by the noble Lord would continue to treat not only civil partners and same-sex cohabiting couples, but also for the first time cohabiting opposite-sex couples, as though they were single people, thus penalising only those who are living together in a marriage. I know that he did not intend to do that, but it was the hook for the debate. However, the noble Lord is right to assume that significant changes will be made, mostly to the financial detriment of same-sex couples who, for the first time&#x2014;whether or not they are in a civil partnership and particularly where they have children. have a low income and are dependent on social security, and particularly where disability is involved&#x2014;will find their household income will be lower than it otherwise has been in the past, although comparable with that of a cohabiting heterosexual couple. That is the package and we cannot walk away from it.</p><p>
            I hope that, with a response which repeats some of what I said in advance of the Second Reading oft his Bill, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

            It is helpful, as the noble Baroness rightly surmised, to try to clarify the situation by tabling a probing amendment. Given all the confusion over tax credits, it is important that those contemplating entering into a same-sex partnership under this Bill if it goes through and receives Royal Assent should be aware of the possible consequences. In that context, it is most helpful to have the words of the noble Baroness on the record. No doubt the noble Lord, Lord Alli, and others will take careful note of the situation, one that is extremely complicated and difficult to understand.</p><p>
            One can only hope that the Government are successful in conveying the position to people. Given the level of take-up, I refer here to everyone&#x2014;not only those in single-sex partnerships&#x2014;either not claiming tax credits or suffering because they have filled in the form and are

            then severely penalised. I am appalled by reports of the attitude now being taken by the Revenue. Making the change from what used to be social security to Inland Revenue organisation of these matters has changed the approach taken by the department now responsible to those who have difficulty understanding the legislation we pass. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

            I was a bit thrown by that last remark&#x2014;that the noble Lord thought that he was improving the Bill by a drafting amendment. My understanding of the purpose of the amendment is that it is a subset of the previous discussion. In other words, it would allow same-sex couples who are not civil partners to be treated as separate individuals. It goes back to the discussion about Janet and John being married. The amendment means that civil partners, married couples and cohabiting opposite-sex couples would be treated as couples, but same-sex non-registered couples would remain as individuals. Therefore, it is the subset of the previous discussion and might helpfully have been grouped with it.</p><p>
            I go back to my previous arguments. The provision comes as part of the package of the read-across. Therefore, I do not believe that the amendment does what the noble Lord believes that it does to improve the drafting, but I shall take advice on the matter. I look to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, because on at least three of the last half a dozen social security Bills he has challenged the wording and has been found to be right when Parliamentary Counsel were incorrect. If he supports the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, I shall certainly come back with a drafting amendment. Otherwise, I shall remain agnostic about whether it improves the drafting.</p><p>
            As the amendment stands, however, I am sure that it does what the noble Lord does not intend it to do. It relates back to the previous discussion and takes a position on equities that the noble Lord would not wish to support. On the basis of the substance of the explanation, I hope that he feels able to withdraw the amendment.

The amendments deal with Northern Ireland, amending Clause 187, which deals with the power to amend enactments relating to pensions. I wonder whether I have said enough.

        The noble Lord said: This is an incredibly inconvenient amendment because, although it comes at the end of a line, it is also at the end of a page, which means that it is difficult to see exactly what it does. The clause seems very wide and, at a later stage, I may express concerns about the extent to which a Minister of the Crown or even a Secretary of State may amend, repeal or even revoke any enactments, subordinate legislation or Church legislation relating to pensions, allowances and so on. The power seems extraordinarily wide, although it is restricted at the end of the paragraph by the words.
        <q>for &#x2026; civil partners or dependants of &#x2026; civil partners'.</q>

        The purpose of the amendment is to restrict the specific mention of pensions to state pensions, by which I mean national insurance pensions. However, I suppose that it could include some public service pensions. It does not seem desirable that the provision be so wide that the Minister could make subordinate legislation that would affect pensions of, let us say, an occupational pension scheme. That seems a bit too wide, so I beg to move.

            If we put "state" in, "Church" becomes very restricted. As ecclesiastical legislation is relevant, we need to make sure that the amendments carry in relation to that sphere. The insertion of "state" may make that difficult.

            It would be extremely unfortunate if the amendment were other than probing, and were to be entertained seriously by the Committee. It would restrict the equity that we are trying to establish in pensions only to state pensions. The noble Lord rightly spotted that some areas might be left out in consequence, such as public sector pensions, but the problem is bigger than that.</p><p>
            I shall stand back and expand on the matter a bit, because the area of pensions is of major importance to us all. The Bill seeks to extend survivor pension rights to civil partners. The amendment would deny civil partners the rights to certain occupational pensions. The noble Lord does not think that the state has any necessary fiat writ there except public sector pensions. That is where the gap opens between us, because that is not the case.</p><p>
            The noble Lord mentioned, when he checked just now, that Schedule 17 deals with all the state benefits. including pensions. Clause 187 was included in the Bill specifically to provide a power that would allow for necessary amendments to the contracting-out provisions, as well as public sector pension schemes and other legislation in respect of certain pensions, so that survivors' benefits may be extended to civil partners.</p><p>
            
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_495gc' title='Col. 495GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 May 2004 vol 661 c495GC' name='column_495gc' href='#column_495gc' rel='bookmark'>495GC</a>
            The noble Lord will know that the contracting-out rights are the bit of national insurance one has paid that, instead of going into SERPS or what would now be the state second pension, are looped into the occupational pension. That is providing that, but only that, the private occupational scheme into which those NI rebates are invested provides a level of benefit at least equal under the reference scheme test to what would have been obtained under the state second pension. That means, for example, accrual rights of at least 40 80ths, and a survivor's pension of at least 50 per cent.</p><p>
            Should one need ever to change that, one would need powers under the clause to come back to occupational pensions. Therefore, it is not the case that the state's interest in pensions begins and ends with the classic basic state retirement pension. It underpins the good enough provisions of the whole private sector realm. That is why we need the powers.</p><p>
            I expected the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, to say something in particular, so let me put it on record now; it will certainly come up again. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, may be right to be concerned that Clause 187 is widely drawn. The Delegated Powers Committee&#x2014;the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, serves on it, and would normally have picked up the matter&#x2014;shared that concern and asked us to take it further. We will reflect on that, and I may very well come back on Report with amendments to make more explicit&#x2014;through either affirmative or negative regulations&#x2014;what the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, seeks.</p><p>
            I could go on at much greater length about what we might propose to do. However, I hope that the noble Lord agrees that, if we were to accept his amendment, we would remove all survivor pension rights in contracted-out legislation to civil partners. He would not want to do that. He assumes that there is a clean line between state and private. There is not, because the contracted-out rebates underpin private sector pensions to a good enough level, equivalent to that of the state second pension. Therefore, we need the powers. We could come back to whether they need to be made more explicit on Report, but that we need them is without doubt. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.

            The issue is serious. As the noble Baroness pointed out, relatively few private pension schemes are totally remote from government one way or another, certainly so far as most occupational pension schemes are concerned, for the reasons that she mentioned; namely, with regard to contracting-out, contracting-in and so on. None the less, I still have some concern in terms of the powers. The right reverend Prelate rightly pointed out that there would be problems given the earlier reference to Church legislation. I understand that point very well and fully accept it. Rather than debating the matter at this stage,

        The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 85A, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 91E. These are the first and only amendments to be tabled by the Liberal Democrats in what has otherwise been a lengthy Committee. I do not think that we will come up with any more, even if the debate goes into another day. I am afraid to say that, after the very rapid pace at which we have been going, I shall have to take a certain amount of time over the amendments and therefore slow down the procedure that we have observed since half-past three.

        The Liberal Democrats have given full support to the principle of the Bill and, indeed, to its text as amended by the very large number of amendments that we have had. The third day of Committee was the first occasion on which I had seen a Marshalled List at least as long as the Bill itself. However, we believe that civil partners are not being fairly treated on certain aspects of occupational pensions. I shall try to explain why. The structure of pensions is, of course, extremely complex. I have been away from pensions for two or three years, having previously employed many and varied vigorous arguments with the Minister. On looking into pensions again after that absence, I found the legislation almost incomprehensible.

        We have the state pension. We have already discussed the category B retirement pension, which in certain respects means that there are distinctions between what is received by members of civil partnerships and members of married couples. For instance, the category B pension under Section 48A of the <a href="/acts/social-security-contributions-and-benefits-act-1992">Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992</a> is not payable to a man if his wife is not born before 6 April 1950. A category B pension under Section 48B is not payable to a man if he reaches the age of 65 before 6 April 2010. When considering how those provisions should be applied to civil partnerships, there is an option to treat all surviving civil partners on the same footing as either widows or widowers. If they are treated as widowers, they are treated less favourably in the circumstances just mentioned.

        The Government have decided to treat the rights of civil partners claiming category B pensions as if they were men&#x2014;this is dealt with in paragraphs 18 and 19 of Schedule 17&#x2014;and, with some reluctance, we accept that principle. We do not think, for example, that there is a sufficient case for treating same-sex couples more favourably than husbands or widowers are treated under the existing law. There might be a case for removing the transitional restrictions on claims by

        We are particularly concerned about occupational pension schemes. There is no statutory requirement of benefit to be provided by occupational pension schemes for widows or widowers outside the guaranteed minimum pension but, in practice, almost all schemes provide such benefits. Following the <span class="italic">Barber</span> decision in the European Court of Justice in 1990, any scheme which provides benefits for widows must also provide equal benefits for widowers. That is a consequence of the equal pay directive of the European Community.

        Schemes frequently give a discretionary right to the trustees to provide benefits for the partner&#x2014;either male or female; same sex or different sex&#x2014;of an employee, and that power nowadays is often used to provide a pension to a same-sex partner. It is very often done through a system whereby the employee can nominate someone who is a cohabitee or a dependant to receive a survivor's pension.

        Public sector pension schemes pay the equivalent of occupational pension schemes but usually on a much more rigid basis and with no discretion to award a pension to an unmarried or same-sex partner. There are of course hybrid or contracted-out schemes in which that part of the state pension provided by SERPS&#x2014;or now by the state second pension&#x2014;is not paid and contributions by the employer and employee are correspondingly reduced. But the scheme has to pay an equivalent amount and there is a guaranteed minimum pension.

        The GMP has to include a benefit for widows and widowers but, in the case of widowers, that is limited to the amount of benefit which a widower would have received if the wife's employment had begun in 1988, even if it began earlier. The same does not apply the other way round. A widow is entitled to the GMP benefit in full whatever date the employment began. The reason for this, I believe, is that the GMP for widowers is required only from 1988 and employers had until then funded their schemes on the basis that they would not have to pay benefits to widowers.

        The Government are proposing to require GMP benefits to be paid to surviving civil partners but to pay them only on the amount that would have been payable if the deceased partner's employment had begun at the date of the commencement of the Bill, which we expect to be not earlier than October next year. It is clear therefore that in a number of respects a surviving civil partner will not for a lengthy transitional period&#x2014;which may be up to 40 years&#x2014;do as well as widows or widowers from occupational pension schemes. There is very little in the Bill about occupational pensions. Clause 187 gives a wide but unspecified power to amend existing pensions legislation, on which we have already had a short debate.

        Schedules 18 and 19 amend some statutory pension schemes to allow civil partners to benefit, but their scope is limited. I have tabled two amendments. The first, Amendment No. 85A, is very general. It seeks to establish the following principle:
        <q>Orders made under subsection (1) shall give effect, so far as possible, to the principle that any person is the civil partner of an earner or pensioner or the surviving civil partner of a deceased earner or pensioner shall have the same right to pension scheme benefits as the spouse of an earner or pensioner or the widow or widower of a deceased earner or pensioner".</q>

        The first issue that I wish to raise is whether the Government intend to legislate to extend the <span class="italic">Barber</span> principle and require any occupational pension scheme, including public sector schemes, which provide benefits for widows and widowers, to provide equivalent benefits for civil partners. If that is not the case, there is a massive lacuna in the Bill and there is still substantial discrimination in pension matters in favour of married couples and against civil partners.

        The second point, which is covered by Amendment No. 91E, is: if occupational pension schemes are provided for civil partners as of right, should the benefit to the surviving civil partner be restricted to benefits based on contributions since the commencement of the Bill, or should it be possible to go back before that date? Providing full benefits would, I think, be no problem with defined contribution schemes, because they would not necessarily require any further contribution by the employer. It would simply mean that pensions that until then had been solely provided for the employee would also have to take into account a civil partner&#x2014;part of it would have to go to the civil partner.

        I can see problems with defined benefit schemes, where giving to civil partners rights equivalent in all respects to those of widows and widowers would require some additional contributions from employers and employees.

            I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I did not quite follow what he was saying on defined contribution schemes. Would I be wrong in thinking that, if the Government legislated in such a way that trustees of a defined contribution scheme were obliged to pay pensions to civil partners, some other members of the scheme would have their pensions reduced?

            Yes. If a defined contribution scheme providing benefits for widows and widowers also provided benefits for civil partners, the civil partner concerned would get less from the pot of money. At present, the civil partner would not have to provide a widow's pension, because he is not married&#x2014;assuming that this applies only to marriages that take place during the course of the employment. Therefore the civil partner concerned would find that he or she received less because part of the pot would provide for the possibility of money going to the surviving civil partner.

            I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord, but I wonder whether we are making clear the difference between a defined benefit and a defined contribution scheme. A defined benefit would have a collective impact on all the members of the scheme because the contributions, along with those made by the employer, have to meet all the promises made. Clearly, in particular in public sector schemes, there would be a liability. A defined contribution scheme is a privately appropriated pot of money used as an annuity by the individual. As the noble Lord said, at the moment an individual, subject to the reference scheme test, can buy a single life, a joint life, an inflation-proof or a level annuity. According to which element of the package he buys, he will get so many thousands per hundred thousand&#x2014;anything between &#x00A3;6,500 to just over &#x00A3;7,000 at today's rates.</p><p>
            With a money purchase scheme, one is simply striking a balance: if you get it for this part, you do not get it for that part. whereas a defined benefit scheme is collectively pooled which reflects irrespectively the total level of contributions. Thus someone who is married would be affected by the decision of a civil partner under a defined benefit scheme, but would not be affected by such a decision under a defined contribution scheme.

            Leaving to one side for a moment the defined benefit scheme because we agree that there are other complications to be considered, so far as the defined contribution scheme is concerned, we are not making any change. What we are talking about could happen under the existing circumstances. As the noble Baroness has rightly pointed out, you pay into the scheme, you receive a given amount and you determine who is the beneficiary. It is wholly irrelevant to the argument.

            I am not absolutely certain of that because in terms of a personal pension, it would be true. However, I do not know whether there are some defined contribution schemes where, although the fund is provided through defined contributions, there are obligations to use the fund not only for the benefit of the employee. The employee is bound and does not really have an option to provide a pension for a surviving spouse.

            That was the reason for my original intervention. If we are referring to a defined contribution scheme of the kind just described by the noble Lord, and if the coverage is extended to include civil partners, the pool remaining for the other members is reduced.

            Perhaps I can help both noble Lords. It depends entirely on whether the scheme is contracted out or not. If a scheme is contracted out, whether a defined benefit or defined contribution scheme, it must meet the standard in terms of benefits of what would have been the state second pension. Clearly, however, accrual rates cannot apply in a defined contribution scheme, but
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_500gc' title='Col. 500GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 May 2004 vol 661 c500GC' name='column_500gc' href='#column_500gc' rel='bookmark'>500GC</a>
            survivors' benefits can do so. However, they apply only for that part of it; the rest&#x2014;the remaining head space&#x2014;is for the individual.</p><p>
            One reason for pension simplification is that someone in a defined contribution scheme may end up buying three or four different parts of a pension in order to package them together, so that some will meet the reference scheme test while other parts do not. One of the simplification procedures that we are going through seeks not just to change the tax changes, but to put in place a common package.

            I am grateful to the noble Baroness and I hope that she has clarified the position for the noble Lord, Lord Higgins.</p><p>
            I return to the question of the defined contribution scheme. I concede that this imposes a certain additional burden on such a scheme, which may therefore require a limited amount of additional funding. But the employee can say, "I have been paying full contributions all my working life, even though I knew I would almost certainly never marry because of my sexual orientation. Why should I now have to pay extra myself to provide benefits for my partner?". But if the partner does not get a full benefit, there would be discrimination against him or her when compared with a widow or widower.</p><p>
            In practice, it seems that little extra funding would be needed in private sector schemes because so many already allow discretionary provisions for partners. The extra cost has been estimated by Stonewall at no more than 0.02 to 0.04 per cent; indeed, that may be somewhat on the high side. It would be, for example, &#x00A3;4 extra out of wages of &#x00A3;10.000.</p><p>
            The big burden is on public sector schemes because they have been very slow to provide for dependants, particularly dependants of same-sex partners. However, the fact that they have been slow is not a reason for excluding the rights of same-sex partners under the Bill.</p><p>
            It seems to me that there is a very strong case for applying the <span class="italic">Barber</span> principle beyond equality between men and women and extending it to equality between civil partners and married couples. If there is no satisfactory reply as to that being the Government's intention, we will come back to the issue on Report.</p><p>
            I turn now to the more limited subject of the GMP. which is covered by Amendment No. 91E. The amendment contains suggested changes to eight different sections of the <a href="/acts/pension-schemes-act-1993">Pension Schemes Act 1993</a>, most of which are consequential. I have not attempted to be complete; I am aware that there are other provisions of the <a href="/acts/pension-schemes-act-1993">Pension Schemes Act 1993</a> which would also require amendment, but they are not directly linked with this issue.</p><p>
            The central change concerns paragraph 4 of Amendment No. 91E. That provides that if the earner is a civil partner who has a guaranteed minimum under that section, the weekly rate is not less than the surviving civil partner's guaranteed minimum. Paragraph 4(3) links the surviving civil partner's guaranteed minimum to the widower's guaranteed minimum. Similarly,
            
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_501gc' title='Col. 501GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 May 2004 vol 661 c501GC' name='column_501gc' href='#column_501gc' rel='bookmark'>501GC</a>
            paragraph 4(4) again links the surviving civil partner's guaranteed minimum to the widower's guaranteed minimum.</p><p>
            I have already explained the reason for this. In funding a pension scheme the actuaries would have assumed that no pensions were to be paid to widowers and they might regard it as unfair to impose what could be seen as a retrospective burden on scheme funds. The effect of this is to backdate the surviving civil partner's pension to 1988, even if the contributions on which the pension is based go back before 1988.</p><p>
            As I have said, the widow's pension is payable on the basis of the total pension obtained by her husband; but a widower's pension under the GMP provisions in Schedule 18 is backdated only as far as 1988, even if the wife's employment and contributions began before that date.</p><p>
            I am asking here not that the date goes back as if the provision related to a widow but as if it were equivalent to the rights of a widower. That is what happens in connection with Schedule 17 and the right to the category B pension. We see some justification for that. Here, however, the surviving civil partner is treated not only less favourably than a widow but less favourably than a widower. We believe that gay and lesbian people, who have paid the same contribution rates but had no prospect of marriage, have subsidised heterosexual couples for many years and should qualify for equal treatment.</p><p>
            Furthermore, the provision would be cheap. The proportion of gay and lesbian people in the country is not large, and the take-up of civil partnerships is likely to be a small percentage of that number&#x2014;perhaps 5 or 10 per cent. Many private sector schemes already provide discretionary benefits for same-sex partners. The extra cost of funding the GMP will therefore be very small.</p><p>
            We believe that it is reasonable to limit retrospectivity to 1988. The reasons are the same as those for the category B pension. The ideal solution would be to make the benefit fully retrospective for everyone, including widowers, but it is too late to do that and it is outside the scope of the Bill. It would be difficult to justify treating surviving male civil pensioners better than widowers, and it would be difficult to justify treating surviving male civil partners differently from female civil partners.</p><p>
            Our conclusion is that surviving civil partners, whether gay or lesbian, should get backdating but should get it only to 1988. That will give 17 years of backdating, which is a substantial part of a working life. For category B pensions, civil partners are treated exactly the same as widowers; for GMP, they are treated less favourably. Justice requires that there should he equal treatment of civil partners. The additional cost of doing so is too small to lead us to reject that conclusion. I beg to move.

            up on clause stand part, so I relate my remarks specifically to points he made about the amendment itself.</p><p>
            The crucial thing to be said right away is that the paragraph that I quoted earlier relates to the enormous powers that the Secretary of State is able to take&#x2014;in the sense that he may amend in whatever way he "considers appropriate". None the less, that power relates to civil partnerships alone. It does not go beyond that, which would go beyond the scope of the Bill.</p><p>
            The existing system for occupational pension schemes has worked well. Trustees have had discretion, and a very large number of cases have extended benefits to various groups&#x2014;in particular, the right of a member to appoint a particular beneficiary or dependant, and so on. That works reasonably well. However, I do not know whether I am at all enthusiastic about extending the provision in a way that restricts the ability of the trustees to operate, taking into account the overall financial situation of the scheme and a number of other implications as far as that aspect of it is concerned. They have considerable powers already so I would. on balance, be in favour of maintaining a discretion. However, I would rather deal with the matter in a broader context when we come to clause stand part.

            I do not have any major experience of pensions, although earlier in my career I published Pensions magazine, which is the industry journal. One thing I did learn was that they are incredibly complicated and change periodically.</p><p>
            This is an area of real importance to many lesbian and gay couples across the country. I have often said in debates in Committee that I warmly welcome the Bill and congratulate the Government on introducing their proposals&#x2014;and, in fact, all Members of the Committee for dealing with the Bill as they have. However, this is the one area on which I disagree with the Government's approach and agree with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, in the various correspondence that I have seen between the Minister and the noble Lord.</p><p>
            The Bill as it stands would allow pension rights for civil partners to accrue only from the date when the Bill is enacted, which is likely to be late 2005. That does not cause a problem for young lesbians and gay men; it is with older couples that the problems begin to occur. I know that my noble friend the Minister is by far and away a greater expert in this area than I am and will tell me the technical reasons why she believes such reforms are not possible.</p><p>
            This is not a technical issue, however. I have heard from the Dispatch Box time and time again, and from an array of Ministers, that the purpose of the Bill is to remedy a mischief. The mischief that it is here to remedy is that same-sex couples cannot register their partnerships. Once that has been done, the read-across would be the same as for marriage. However one dresses it up, that in effect is what was said.</p><p>
            
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_503gc' title='Col. 503GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 May 2004 vol 661 c503GC' name='column_503gc' href='#column_503gc' rel='bookmark'>503GC</a>
            This is the one area where it is not happening. We have remedied the mischief but we have been caught up in a technical argument about a retrospective application of the rules. All I seek, in principle, is for what has been established everywhere else in the Bill to he carried through. The mischief has been remedied; therefore let the rules apply as they would to a married couple.</p><p>
            I also accept the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. Clearly, there is some disparity between women and men and, if we have to compromise, taking the later date would be acceptable. What I do not understand is why the date when the Bill is passed becomes the date of the backdating and not the dates applicable to others.</p><p>
            I know that there is an issue of cost. I have seen the headline figures of &#x00A3;300 million and have stepped back and thought, "That is a lot of money". However, when one unpacks that and sees that not everyone will retire on the day on which the Bill is enacted and that not all the people we are talking about will enter into civil partnerships, that becomes less of a problem. I have received some actuarial advice on this matter&#x2014;and I do not like straying into the world of actuaries, believe you me&#x2014;and the estimates that I have received put the additional cost at somewhere between &#x00A3;6 million and &#x00A3;15 million a year.</p><p>
            I do not want to get into an argument about cost because I do not think cost is at the heart of the matter. The heart of the matter is the principle established in the Bill versus a technical argument. I know that the Minister has some sympathy with my argument, but it is the conflict of the two arguments that we have to resolve; the technical point over the principle. In my view, the matter is mainly about fairness. Lesbian and gay couples have made the same contributions and deserve the same pensions in return. It is not about special treatment; it is about equality. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain to me why the two principles are clashing and why the Government have chosen the latter rather than the former.

            I recognise that this is probably the substantive issue that divides the Committee. It concerns being opposed to any kind of state recognition of any relationship other than marriage at any point&#x2014;unless, of course, you happen to be living in sin but none the less covered by social security, in which case we are perfectly happy to catch you on the way down but not on the way up.</p><p>
            Leaving that aside, I recognise that there is a real division of views. I shall set out the two general points&#x2014;I shall not base them on costs&#x2014;before I go into detail about the amendment. The first point concerns the issue of retrospection; and the second concerns the issue of dependent status and hardship.</p><p>
            As to the issue of parity, if you like, both the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and my noble friend Lord Alli argued that all they are seeking to achieve is parity with widowers; not with widows. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, seems to think that their rights go

            back somewhat further but they do not; they go back to 1978 and widowers' to 1988. However, there was consensus that they should go back to 1988 for equal treatment with widowers.</p><p>
            In the Bill we are seeking to treat civil partners in exactly the same way as we treated widowers in 1988. We are not backdating to the time when widows received their rights. We are saying that all pension rights for widowers are prospective and they cannot buy extra years. So the argument at the core of the position of both noble Lords&#x2014;which is that they want parity and fairness of treatment with widowers; ideally with widows but, if not, with widowers&#x2014;is not well founded in my view.

            In fairness, my argument is not about parity but about remedying the mischief. The principle of the Bill has been that once you have remedied the mischief the rules applying to heterosexual couples who are married then come into force. This is the only part of the Bill where that does not apply. With respect, that argument is not the same as the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. He is arguing a principled position, which I support; my argument is that we are diverting from a principle, stated at the Dispatch Box, which every Minister has hitherto applied to every other section.

            No. I am not aware of any situation in the broad field of pensions in which legislation has ever been retrospective. Funded or unfunded rights which come back through a private pension are accrued over time.

            From my limited research, in 1994 there was a court ruling that allowed female part-time workers who had been excluded from occupational pension schemes to backdate their contributions to 1976. The contributions would also have to be matched by their employers&#x2014;I accept that&#x2014;but there is an example of retrospection.

            No, it was not. The ECJ ruled that part-timers should have been eligible to join the scheme since 1976 and that they had been unfairly denied their rights in the intervening period. This is the Preston case. As a result, their rights were retrospectively backdated to the point at which the clock should have started ticking. That is not the situation here.</p><p>
            These are not rights that have been illegally denied to people; these are rights that will be carried from the point when the Bill is enacted. There is therefore no read across to the Preston case, nor, I suggest, to the Barber case. I am happy to reply more extensively in writing to my noble friend. However, I have looked into the matter and it is very clear that the Preston case rectified the fact that the part-timers had been illegally denied rights that they should have enjoyed for the previous period. That is not the case here. Preston was not retrospective but my noble friend's stance would make the pension retrospective.

            I think that I have a legitimate argument, although the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, disagrees with it. Retrospectivity existed in the case that I mentioned. The Minister has not answered my point that in every other section of the Bill&#x2014;not this section, I accept&#x2014;the principle has been established in this way. I merely seek the reason for its not being applied here. If the reason is not cost, I would like to get to the heart of the argument.

            I reassert that I do not recognise my noble friend's argument that the part-timer's case is an example of retrospectivity to which we can read across. It is asserted, not that the rights have been retrospectively backdated, but that, since that period, you have acted illegally and the position is being corrected. There is a major difference between the two. What would have been retrospective was, for example, if widowers in 1988, when they acquired their rights to draw down from a survivor's pension, had those rights backdated to before the Bill&#x2014;that is to say, to the point at which widows drew them, in 1978. That might have generated cost issues and would have served my noble friend's purpose. But, of course, it did not; it was not; and it was not made so. That is why, in all fairness, one would find it difficult to find a case of retrospection in the pension field or in social security more generally&#x2014;except when rectifying where you have acted illegally or where there is a case coming through whose judgment is, say, two years down the line and you put into suspense accounts all lookalike cases and return to deal with them once the leading case has been dealt with, as happens in some aspects of social security law.</p><p>
            My noble friend may not welcome my second argument, which refers to the previous discussion about dependency pensions. We are dealing with people who will mostly have had access to the labour market and have incurred pensions in their own right. If, as a result of certain circumstances, such as having children or disability, they are unable to retire on their own pension&#x2014;as will be the case, unlike 88 per cent of married women&#x2014;they will have access to their own pension over and beyond any rights to a survivor's pension. That is not the case with existing widows, which is why the survivor's pension was originally invented. Where that is not the case, people in a civil partnership will have access to pension credit.</p><p>
            I rest my case, although I will deal with the amendments as this is a major debate and it was dealt with at great length by the noble Lord. He is entitled to a full reply as best as I can give it. The core of my case is not cost, although it is a serious consideration. The cost that we have been given is some &#x00A3;300 million. The core is that pension legislation is about the building up of accrued rights. This Bill is not about retrospection, as the noble Lord argues; it is about the future rights that people may enjoy. Where you are dealing with income-related social security benefits, such as housing benefit or tax credits, you take a snapshot. You ask whether the couple is same-sex, opposite sex and living together as a household. Those benefits click in from the moment you take that snapshot. Pensions, as with mortgages and the like,
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_506gc' title='Col. 506GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 May 2004 vol 661 c506GC' name='column_506gc' href='#column_506gc' rel='bookmark'>506GC</a>
            involve benefits for which both entry and exit strategies are required, because rights are accrued over time. You must therefore decide when you start clocking those up. That is why they are not similar to other sorts of benefits. Because of that aspect of occupational pensions, you need to start clocking up rights when the Bill comes into effect&#x2014;that may be in a year's time. In that way we ensure equal treatment with all other extensions of pension provision that, as far as I am aware, we have seen in the past. We will treat civil partners in exactly the same way as we treated widowers in 1988. No more and no less. To do otherwise would be to say to civil partners, "We will treat you more generously than we treated widowers at that time". I am not sure that that argument would necessarily commend itself to people.

            This is my last intervention. What my noble friend says does not take the point. What I am seeking is that they be treated in the same way as heterosexuals are treated now, not as they were treated either in 1988 or 1979. What concerns me is how they are treated now. Legislation and public opinion has changed over the intervening period. The point here is that we may find ourselves putting in place a prejudice in legislation.

            I simply disagree because these are accrued rights. At a certain point you enter the accrual of rights and build them up, and at a certain point you draw them down either as a pension or as a survivor's pension. That is why there is no direct read-across to the position of heterosexuals. Let us take, for example, a cohabiting couple. One of the partners may well not be able to draw down the pension of their partner because the law does not permit it.</p><p>
            I repeat that this is not about unfairness in any form. Pensions must be built up as a body of accrued rights over time to which someone is entitled as of right because they will have made contributions in that status. That was true for widows from 1978 and for widowers from 1988; it will be true for civil partners when this Bill becomes law.</p><p>
            I realise that my noble friend does not share that view, but all I can say in response is that I think there is a genuine difference of philosophy here. I believe that pension rights are accrued rights which kick in at an agreed point in time. They are not backdated to when a partnership began, or to any other event. They accrue from the point that this Bill, with parliamentary support, becomes law. That is the difference between us.</p><p>
            Arguments can be made on the grounds of cost or financial hardship, but I do not base my argument on those; rather it is about the nature of retrospectivity. When considering the broader issues of pensions&#x2014;I certainly do not accept either the Preston or the Barber cases as precedents&#x2014;then we must consider issues of retrospectivity and accrued rights and whether you can acquire rights that you did not have at the time the clock started to tick. I would find it difficult to go down that road.</p><p>

            If noble Lords wish, I can go over each of the amendments in turn. However, again to make the case, I remind the Committee that when the requirement to provide limited price indexation on pensions rights was introduced in 1977, it was not made retrospective. It applied only to rights accrued on pensionable service after the date of introduction. I suspect that I could produce a list as long as my arm of changes made to pensions legislation&#x2014;mostly to people's benefit, but sometimes to their detriment&#x2014;which are not retrospective. They apply to the future rights that accrue. On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, will withdraw his amendment.</p><p>
            As I have said, I could go into much greater detail, but this is a philosophical point. I do not make my case primarily on the grounds of cost, although I am satisfied that the cost of &#x00A3;300 million is robust. I do not even argue the case on the grounds of need, although the widow's pension originally arose out of financial hardship and need, which is less likely to be relevant here. Rather, I make my argument on the grounds of fairness; that is, in all fairness, every change in accrued rights has been prospective and not retrospective. I have to say that I have not heard any arguments today which persuade me that the Government should take a different position.

            Before I make my final remarks, would the noble Baroness answer what was perhaps the most important question I put to her: do the Government intend to require pension schemes that provide benefits as of right for widows and widowers to extend them on the lines of the Barber principle to civil partnerships on, let us say, a non-retrospective basis?

            What we are saying is that the part of the pension covered by contracting-out rights is covered by this Bill. The reference scheme test will apply so that civil partners will be entitled to the same benefits as those enjoyed by spouses. A surviving civil partner will have the same benefits as a widow or widower would have, which is the 50 per cent survivor's pension based on the 40-eightieths accrual rate of the pension.</p><p>
            Secondly, not in this Bill but as a result of the sexual discrimination regulations of December 2003, where trustees offer a level of benefit superior to that of the reference scheme test&#x2014;most private sector schemes do so&#x2014;such as a 60-sixtieth accrual rather 40-eightieths, and where that is offered to spouses, it must also be offered to civil partners, and where it is offered to unmarried opposite-sex partners, it must be offered to same-sex partners.</p><p>
            In this Bill, the reference scheme test that provides a floor of benefits at least as good as what is provided by the state second pension is covered. Spouses and similar partners will be treated equally. If trustees offer no more than that, they do not have to do any more, but if they offer benefits above that&#x2014;as most of them do within that headspace&#x2014;they will come under the framework of the European regulations. What they do

            for spouses they must do for civil partners, and what they do for unmarried opposite-sex couples they must do for unmarried same-sex couples. If regulations from the DTI are needed to make that clear, we shall bring those forward.

            I shall speak briefly on this occasion. The question of retrospectivity is the main issue between us. We do not regard two wrongs as making a right. We believe that gay and lesbian workers have subsidised the pensions of heterosexuals, in particular married heterosexuals, and in that respect there is a difference from 1988, because it could not be said that before that year, women's contributions subsidised men's pensions. Women have a longer life expectancy and so benefit by paying the same contributions for what is likely to be a longer pension payment. Therefore providing for widowers was not righting a wrong comparable with our proposals for retrospectivity here, although in terms of giving a bonus, it is understandable that retrospectivity might not be appropriate.</p><p>
            Be that as it may, clearly this is an important issue. It is one, although almost certainly not the only one, that we will seek to raise again on Report. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

        The noble Lord said: This is a minor amendment compared with the issues we have just been discussing. There appears to be inconsistency in this subsection. The overall thrust of the Bill has been to state that same-sex partnerships should be treated in the same way as opposite-sex partnerships or marriages. Subsection (4) says:
        <q>The provision which may be made by virtue of subsection (1) may be the same as, or different to. the provision made with respect to widows, widowers or the dependants of persons who are not civil partners".</q>

            The noble Lord was right in his hints on this. We are dealing with different retirement ages and therefore with a different read-across between husbands and wives and civil partners. That is the reason for the phraseology; he is exactly right. I am happy to go beyond that if he would like.

            A number of points here are worth pursuing. Some were raised during our earlier debate on the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. We need to put the issue in perspective. As I pointed out earlier, it is important to bear in mind that in Clause 187 the discretion given to the Minister in making subordinate legislation is extremely wide, in as much that it covers Church legislation, gratuities, pensions allowances and so on. It is also wide in the sense that it refers to whatever he considers is appropriate in the context of pensions and so on related to civil partners. He has considerable discretion in that respect, but the clause is none the less restricted, if I understand it correctly, to the question of making these provisions with regard to civil partners. This may be relevant in particular to occupational schemes generally and more specifically to public service pensions, which are referred to later in the Bill.</p><p>
            One must put this in the context of the serious impact that the Government's policy has had on occupational pensions, in particular the way in which successive measures&#x2014;starting with the &#x00A3;5 billion being removed by the Chancellor on so on&#x2014;have led to an absolutely catastrophic decline.

            I certainly believe that the appalling decline in final salary schemes and the shift towards defined contribution schemes, together with, as the noble Baroness constantly points out&#x2014;and I agree with her&#x2014;a substantial reduction in the size of the employer's contribution in many cases where the transfer has taken place, is a very sad situation.</p><p>
            I feel very strongly that the remaining final salary schemes are likely to be seriously affected by the <a href="/bills/pensions-bill">Pensions Bill</a> and the additional costs which will he incurred in protecting the position of pensioners. This is also an area where, perhaps sadly, we may find that
            
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_511gc' title='Col. 511GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 May 2004 vol 661 c511GC' name='column_511gc' href='#column_511gc' rel='bookmark'>511GC</a>
            trustees of final salary schemes decide that that is another reason why they should switch to a defined contribution scheme.</p><p>
            It is important that the discretion that trustees have hitherto had in these matters should be retained. As has been pointed out, many occupational pension schemes and their trustees have been more advanced than the Government or state schemes&#x2014;I am glad to see that the noble Baroness agrees with me&#x2014;in extending benefits to partners and co-habiting couples, and even to those an individual may specify to be the recipient of a survivor's pension. They have been very progressive and it is reasonable to suppose that they will continue to be so in this case. In circumstances where this is not so, there is a danger that they will switch to defined contribution schemes.</p><p>
            We have to look very carefully at the situation. We have already gone, at considerable length, into the question of retrospection. Like the noble Baroness, I have been trying to think of an example where there has been retrospection. In one sense, the Bill that gave pensions to people left out of the Beveridge scheme when we legislated in 1970 would be something of that kind where, albeit very belatedly, they got pensions to which they had not contributed. But it is certainly difficult to find any precedent, as the noble Baroness pointed out.</p><p>
            Like the noble Lord, Lord Alli, I do not think the issue of cost is necessarily important here. My Treasury halo shudders slightly at that point. There is an important point of principle but the retrospective argument is difficult to accept for the reasons given by the noble Baroness.</p><p>
            Another point worth raising in this clause stand part debate is the position of public service pensions. Unlike the private sector&#x2014;where, as I say, trustees have been rather progressive&#x2014;the public service schemes, which are usually governed by regulations made by the appropriate Secretary of State, have tended to be rather unforthcoming in that kind of situation. The positions of the Civil Service scheme and&#x2014;if one dare say it in the context of the present industrial dispute&#x2014;the scheme of what I used to call firemen but who are now firefighters are not as favourable as they might be. One can go right across the board so far as the NHS and so on are concerned. Again, they do not provide for pensions to be paid to someone who is not a legally married spouse, although many private schemes do. The NHS is lagging behind the private sector schemes. The police pension scheme does not provide for same-sex couples and other designated beneficiaries. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether it will under the Bill.</p><p>
            To the extent that charity begins at home, it is important that we look at those individual schemes. Dare one mention that the situation with regard to parliamentary salaries has been somewhat eased? However, in the later clauses and particularly the schedules to which I have referred, we find the most extraordinary degree of specific provision when, at the same time, this clause gives so much discretion to the Minister. If I understand matters correctly, we propose
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_512gc' title='Col. 512GC &mdash; HL Deb 25 May 2004 vol 661 c512GC' name='column_512gc' href='#column_512gc' rel='bookmark'>512GC</a>
            to legislate for a potential same-sex partner of a Prime Minister's widow or Speaker's widow. That seems an unnecessary degree of detail if no more.</p><p>
            I express a personal view here; Members of the Committee know that the Opposition are on a free vote. Overall, my feeling is that it would be unfortunate if private schemes were forced to act in the way described. Their discretion so far has been better than that in the public service, and in many other ways. We shall return to the clause on Report, and no doubt take up the points on retrospection dealt with by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in his amendments.

            The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, basically made three points. I conceded one, which was about the state of Clause 187 and the breadth of its powers. We picked that up in an earlier discussion. Given that the Delegated Powers Committee has expressed concern about the regulations, we need to come back to that; it is common ground.</p><p>
            The noble Lord agreed with my understanding of pension policy, law and arrangements in the past and the fact that they have not been retrospective. He has much greater experience of that than me. He is absolutely right on the substance of his points, which were on the discrepancy between the treatment of private sector and public sector schemes. The only public service scheme that can pay benefits to cohabiting partners, if one pays contributions, is the Civil Service scheme. All the other public sector schemes do not even&#x2014;that is not meant to sound as though there is a pecking order; rather there is development over time&#x2014;have arrangements for cohabiting opposite-sex couples, let alone putting their feet in the water of this issue of same-sex partners.</p><p>
            At least 20 per cent to 25 per cent of private sector schemes&#x2014;a substantial number&#x2014;already have arrangements for cohabiting opposite-sex couples, and 8 per cent have a named dependant, who can be a same-sex partner. The numbers are still fairly small but the noble Lord was right to say that the private sector has shown itself more imaginative and more inclusive&#x2014;and, apparently, more responsive to the nature of its labour force and staff&#x2014;than has the public sector.</p><p>
            Should Parliament approve this Bill, all public schemes that produce benefits for spouses will have to produce benefits for civil partners. Unless they have benefits for co-habiting opposite-sex couples, there is no such obligation on them to extend that to cohabiting same-sex couples. That may be another battle to fight on another day for both heterosexual and same-sex couples alike.</p><p>
            The measure will have implications for the public sector because some of the schemes are quite expensive&#x2014;the police schemes, local authority schemes and so on.

            I do not know whether the noble Lord would like me to pick up on any further point. He is right to identify the clause as carrying the major charge for the Government's attempts to ensure equity of treatment between spouses and civil partners in occupational pensions. I hope that is what we shall achieve.

            I believe that it is generally agreed that we shall need to return to these issues on Report, particularly in relation to occupational pension schemes and the question of whether those already in schemes are likely to find their benefits reduced or contributions increased as a result of the changes that the Government appear to envisage the Secretary of State will impose. I myself would prefer the change to be discretionary. The other issue is that so many final salary schemes are not only in a hazardous situation but also in deficit. To that extent, this change will result in an increase in the deficit in existing schemes.

            The Treasury has never been worried about whether the costs were substantial&#x2014;it would be a serious error to suppose that that was so. There are varying degrees of substantiality&#x2014;or, as Lady Docker once said, "We are fed up with being poor or varying degrees of poor". That is basically the attitude that the Treasury takes, in my experience.</p><p>
            There are important issues here, particularly given the perilous situation of many final salary schemes. We shall have to consider carefully the points that the Minister made about public service schemes, which, as she rightly points out, have not been doing well in comparison with private schemes. That is yet another reason for considering whether discretion should be taken into account for those private schemes, particularly given the financial situation of many of them.

Amendment No. 92H makes a technical change to Clause 193(1) by adding "revocations" after "repeals".

        The noble Baroness said: This is a simple amendment which inserts a new entry into Schedule 1 to the <a href="/acts/interpretation-act-1978">Interpretation Act 1978</a> to define the terms "civil partnership" and "civil partner". Under Sections 5 and 23 of the <a href="/acts/interpretation-act-1889">Interpretation Act</a>, if an expression listed in Schedule 1 is used in any Act or subordinate legislation, it is to be interpreted in accordance with that schedule unless the Act or subordinate legislation in question shows a contrary intention. The amendment means that references in other legislation to "civil partnership" or "civil partner" will be interpreted by reference to the <a href="/bills/civil-partnership-bill">Civil Partnership Bill</a>. This will ensure that courts, tribunals and others who use and interpret the legislation are given a clear signpost to this Bill. It will also save those drafting legislation from any uncertainty about whether to include specific definitions. I beg to move.

        The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 92K, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 92L and 105. We are coming to the end of our list of amendments. These amendments will ensure that all the provisions of Part IV of the <a href="/acts/welfare-reform-and-pensions-act-1999">Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999</a> apply to civil partnerships.

        Amendment No. 92K allows the trustees or managers of a pension scheme to discharge liability for pension credit benefit in respect of civil partners in the same way as they would for a married couple. In particular, this amendment means that where the consent of a widow or widower is required, the consent of a surviving civil partner will be required.
      </p>

        Amendment No. 92L extends the existing regulation-making power relating to the provision of information, the calculation and verification of benefits under a pension arrangement and the charging by pension arrangements so that they will apply where financial provision is made in connection with a dissolution, nullity or separation order made in relation to a civil partnership. Furthermore, the amendments ensure that the provisions relating to the activation of pension-sharing orders apply to civil partnerships and that references to matrimonial documents are amended to include documents relevant to where a civil partnership is dissolved or annulled. In other words, pension-sharing, which currently applies to the dissolution of a marriage and the review of matrimonial assets to divide them appropriately, would also now apply to the ending of a civil partnership.
      </p>

        Amendment No. 105 is required to delete words as a consequence of inserting the text of Amendment 92L in Schedule 20. Those words do not change how existing legislation on pension-sharing works; they merely extend its provisions from spouses to same-sex couples who have formed a civil partnership and now wish to end it. I beg to move.

        The noble Lord said: I am delighted to speak to the Government's amendments to Schedule 21, which deals with consequential amendments for Scotland. Part 3 of the Bill, providing for the formation of civil partnerships in Scotland, was approved by the Committee on 13 May. Although I very much welcome the Committee's swift consensus on those clauses, noble Lords' generosity denied me the opportunity to speak in support of Scotland's inclusion in the Bill&#x2014;a very important matter. I hope that the Committee will allow me to say a few words now.

        The Scottish clauses in the <a href="/bills/civil-partnership-bill">Civil Partnership Bill</a> achieve the same policy purpose as Part 2 but have been drafted to reflect the special characteristic of Scots law. In earlier debate on the equivalent clauses for England and Wales, the Committee considered at some length the underlying principles of civil registration for same-sex couples as well as consideration of policy details. It was a good and thorough debate, and I was gratified that Members agreed that the Committee's time should not be spent revisiting those issues in respect of Scotland.

        From the outset, the Scottish Executive has been clear that including Scottish provisions in the UK's Civil Partnership Bill was the most appropriate way of developing legislation in this complex area. The rights and responsibilities that flow from civil partnerships affect matters such as pensions, benefits and taxation, which are reserved to the Westminster Parliament, but also devolved policy areas such as family law&#x2014;for example, what happens when one partner dies? It would be conceivable for the Scottish Parliament to legislate separately on the devolved areas. However, the intertwining of reserved and devolved policies would make the legislation complex, unwieldy and little understood by the people who will use and benefit from it. It would not be in the best interests of consistency and clarity to proceed with different legislation north and south of the Border.

        Such an approach could also lead to problematic cross-Border issues; for example, any difference in the timing of the introduction of civil partnership legislation in Scotland as compared with the rest of the UK could give rise to undesirable anomalies. If, for example, there was a period in which a civil partnership could be registered only in England or Wales, a Scottish couple could still travel south and register their partnership, but what would that mean when they returned to Scotland? They would still have access to the relevant state benefits, taxation and other reserved rights, but not to any of the family law-related benefits, which are devolved. Should such a partnership break down, the couple could not have it dissolved in the Scottish courts.

        Separate legislation could mean that there were differences in detail in the rights and responsibilities flowing from civil partnerships in Scotland and those in England and Wales. It would mean that if couples moved from one part of the UK to another, their rights and responsibilities could vary. That would riot help anyone.

        The inclusion of Scottish provisions in the Bill engages the Sewel convention. The proposed use of a Sewel Motion was among the matters on which the Scottish Executive invited comment when they went out to consultation on civil partnerships last year. The results were very positive, with 86 per cent of respondents agreeing with a proposal to provide legal recognition to same-sex couples in Scotland, and 74 per cent agreeing with the proposed use of a Sewel Motion.

        Parliament has already taken written evidence from a range of interested organisations and individuals. On 12 May, the Justice 1 Committee took oral evidence from the Law Society of Scotland, Professor Kenneth Norrie&#x2014;a leading Scottish academic&#x2014;and the deputy Minister for Justice.

        The Sewel Motion will be voted on in due course and well within the prescribed timescale. It must be agreed by the Scottish Parliament before the last amending stage of this Bill in the Lords. I hope that the Committee agrees that the inclusion of Scottish provisions in the Bill is key to a clear, consistent approach to civil partnerships across the UK.
