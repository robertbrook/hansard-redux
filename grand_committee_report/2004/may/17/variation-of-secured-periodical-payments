        45 (1) This paragraph applies if the person liable to make payments under a secured periodical payments order has died.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0661P0-03743'>
        <a class='permalink' href='#S5LV0661P0_20040517_GCR_354' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        (2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3), an application under this Part relating to the order may be made by&#x2014;
        <ol>
        <li>(a) the person entitled to payments under the periodical payments order, or</li>
        <li>(b) the personal representatives of the deceased person.</li></ol>

        <a class='permalink' href='#S5LV0661P0_20040517_GCR_355' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        (3) No such application may be made without the leave of the court after the end of 6 months from the date on which representation in regard to the estate of that person is first taken out.
      </p>

        <a class='permalink' href='#S5LV0661P0_20040517_GCR_356' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        (4) The personal representatives of the person who has died are not liable for having distributed any part of the estate of the deceased after the end of the 6 month period on the ground that they ought to have taken into account the possibility that the court might allow an application under this paragraph to be made after that period by the person entitled to payments under the order.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0661P0-03746'>
        <a class='permalink' href='#S5LV0661P0_20040517_GCR_357' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        (5) Sub-paragraph (4) does not affect any power to recover any part of the estate so distributed arising by virtue of the making of an order in pursuance of this paragraph.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0661P0-03747'>
        <a class='permalink' href='#S5LV0661P0_20040517_GCR_358' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        (6) In considering for the purposes of sub-paragraph (3) the question when representation was first taken out a grant limited to part of the estate is to be disregarded unless a grant limited to the remainder of the estate has previously been made or is made at the same time.
