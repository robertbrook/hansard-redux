        <ol>
        <li>(a) serving written notice of the application on the respondent, and</li>
        <li>(b) allowing the respondent, within the period of 14 days from the date of the serving of that notice, an opportunity to make written representations,</li></ol>

        (4) If an application has been made under sub-paragraph (1), the clerk may, if he considers it inappropriate to exercise his power under sub-paragraph (2), refer the matter to the court which, subject to paragraph 37, may vary the order by exercising one of its powers under Article 85(3)(a) to (d) of the 1981 Order.

        (2) If the court does not propose to exercise its power under Article 85(3)(c), or (d) of the 1981 Order, the court must, unless upon representations expressly made in that behalf by the person to whom payments under the order are required to be made it is satisfied that it is undesirable to do so, exercise its power under Article 85(5)(b).
