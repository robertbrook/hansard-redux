        The noble Baroness said: I wish to move this amendment and to speak to Amendment No. 336B. I do so with a little trepidation because this whole area of pensions is increasingly complex. There are very serious questions about whether the current structure will serve us in the future. Certainly last week's Pensions Commission report made clear that the whole area is very complex. Support for a universal state pension is growing; I am drawn to it. We will have

        My two amendments do not help with the simplicity argument; I accept that immediately. They are probing amendments, however, so the Minister can take comfort from that. The amendments do not deal solely with the position of women, but, because of the position of women on pensions, the majority of beneficiaries under them would be women.

        It is interesting that in all the coverage that the Pensions Commission report rightly drew last week, I saw none that drew out the position of women in receipt of pensions in the UK&#x2014;I guess there must have been some. Sixty-four per cent of retired people are women, and yet on retirement they receive on average 50 per cent of the income that men receive. It is a big area of concern.

        Amendment No. 336A is about persons entitled to a category A retirement pension, which is paid throughout life. I have two areas of concern. First, although credits are given to those who are paid carer's allowance, to qualify one must be a carer for at least 35 hours a week. My amendment would change that to 20 hours. The figure of 35 hours a week is arbitrary. We should remember that many carers also work part-time and do not meet the 35-hour requirement.
      </p>

        The Minister rightly referred earlier today to the home responsibility protection payments. Those are certainly a great help, reducing the number of years in which one must contribute in order to qualify for the basic state pension. Over the years, a number of Members of the Committee have argued for that very positive move. However, the payments will apply only in relation to children under 16. As for the second state pension, it will apply only to care for children up to the age of six. I listened with great interest to the compelling points that the Minister made earlier. The flaw in the arrangements is that they apply only to total years. If someone works for only one week in a tax year, she will not qualify. It is very arbitrary. Receipt of any other benefit also will exclude her from entitlement to the benefit.

        I do not wish to take up too much of the Committee's time. However, these two amendments are a manifestation of the great unfairness to women in our present pensions system.

        I turn to Amendment No. 336B. Some 41 per cent of women in work are working part-time. It is an enormous percentage. In Britain, about two-thirds of married women with families are working. Thirty years ago, the figure was about 50 per cent. Outside Scandinavia, Britain has the highest number of working married women in Europe, I think; I am not sure whether that is still true.

        I believe that the Minister's heart is with me on Amendment No. 336B, even if her head or logic may not allow her to be because of the complexity in a number of other issues. The whole nature of work is changing. The idea of a job for life is gone. Many people, men included, now have to work for up to four employers. All of that employment may be low-paid.
        
        <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_179gc' title='Col. 179GC &mdash; HL Deb 18 October 2004 vol 665 c179GC' name='column_179gc' href='#column_179gc' rel='bookmark'>179GC</a>
        Cumulatively, that employment may pay them a higher wage than the lower earnings level for a pension. Individually, it may not, and that is where the system falls down. Anyone earning from a single employment will not qualify. On recent figures, 1.4 million women earn less than the lower earnings level of &#x00A3;70-odd a week, so they do not start to qualify, even if they want to pay into a state pension. We are perpetuating in a way the anomaly whereby although a majority of retirees are women, a substantial minority are on an unfeasibly low income and have to rely on state support.

        I fully accept the complexity of the issue. These are probing amendments. As for reviewing pension schemes, I believe that the universal state pension would deal with many of the anomalies we have talked about today and in earlier amendments. However, these amendments do not deal with that. I beg to move.

            I rise to support the amendment moved by my noble friend. As all those who have been discussing the Adair Turner report and pensions issues in general know, those most at risk when it comes to low pay and so forth are women. Those suffering poverty in retirement are in the main women, for the obvious reason that many of them have an interrupted work pattern. They care for children and, later on, may care for elderly relatives. The Government often pay tribute to how much we all owe to carers, so I hope that my noble friend at the Dispatch Box will look at what has been said with a great deal of sympathy.</p><p>
            The same arguments apply to those in part-time employment, who again are mostly women. When they come to retire, if they have a pension at all, it is related to very low pay and they mostly depend almost entirely on state benefits.</p><p>
            I apologise for not being here earlier. I was at a meeting of OPAS, and it so happens that the service has just produced a very good report about women and pensions.

            Both noble Baronesses who have just spoken have distinguished records in the field of pensions and trade union action in that regard. One must acknowledge that. It is right that they should stress the continuing unfair position of women. Having said that, and in the light of Turner, there is no doubt that we have to look to the future. Both parties, whichever may be in power, will have to make significant changes in this direction.</p><p>
            There is only anomaly about Beveridge which has always worried me over the years; that is, married women receive a married woman's pension towards which they and their spouse have contributed no more than a single, unmarried person. That was understandable at the time of Beveridge, but is not really sustainable any longer. For many years we have been seriously disadvantaging the position of unmarried women. In looking forward on these issues, we shall need to take that point into account. It is a strange situation, given present-day circumstances,
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_180gc' title='Col. 180GC &mdash; HL Deb 18 October 2004 vol 665 c180GC' name='column_180gc' href='#column_180gc' rel='bookmark'>180GC</a>
            although as I say it was entirely understandable at the time of Beveridge. However, as both noble Baronesses have remarked, we need to look carefully at the Turner report and decide which are the fair ways we can adjust the position so far as concerns women pensioners.

            I was expecting a more extended debate. I note that my noble friend has grouped her two amendments together. She has rightly anticipated to some extent where I may be seeking to go.</p><p> 
            Noble Lords will know that home responsibilities protection was introduced by Barbara Castle to protect the basic state pension by reducing the number of qualifying years needed for a full pension to a minimum of 20 years. HRP is simple, broad based and cost effective. Just in case there is any misunderstanding, I should explain that one week's work would not remove HRP. Any year where a person is caring and earns under 52 times the lower earnings limit&#x2014;around &#x00A3;4,000&#x2014;will be covered. It may be that my noble friend's worries on this point are not entirely well founded. There is often a misunderstanding about exactly how HRP works.</p><p>
            However, this amendment would go further than perhaps my noble friend appreciates, because many of my concerns about it are related to issues that she did not raise. Removing the 20-year requirement in the HRP provision would allow a person who has spent most of his or her working life outside the labour market to get a full state pension. The costs of that would have to be met by those in work, including other parents.</p><p>
            Earlier we discussed an amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, which sought to extend the cut-off point for help through the S2P for people caring for children by raising it from the age of six to the age of 12. The new clause proposed by my noble friend would remove the age restriction completely so that, provided child benefit is payable, a person could receive help through the S2P on the basis that they are caring for a 19 year-old, who if they are not in full-time education could have been in waged work. Indeed, they could have been married. So I am not sure whether my noble friend intended the consequence of her amendment, but I am sure of the effect. Moreover, the costs would be very significant, running at over &#x00A3;3 billion by 2050.

        The amendment would also extend help to carers looking after disabled people for 20 hours a week or more. The current limit is 35 hours a week. This limit is used not only for HRP and S2P, but also and importantly&#x2014;for the carer's allowance, which my noble friend will know is triggered by the disabled person being cared for qualifying for the middle or higher rate of disability living allowance.

        I have worried about this issue because I think that there is a problem regarding those who are caring sometimes for two people for 20 hours each a week. However, the difficulty here&#x2014;I have been trying to
        
        <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_181gc' title='Col. 181GC &mdash; HL Deb 18 October 2004 vol 665 c181GC' name='column_181gc' href='#column_181gc' rel='bookmark'>181GC</a>
        find a way through&#x2014;is that it is easy to cover in law responsibilities for looking after children by relating those duties to their age. They are born and reach a certain age, so there is an easy audit trail. However, with caring it is not easy once you move away from clear passport entitlements such as middle-rate DLA, 35 hours of caring duties and the carer's allowance. Below that, should we allow for someone who generously helps to keep afloat five different people, each for a package of between three and five hours? How would we put together a paper trail for that?
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0665P0-04734'>
        <a class='permalink' href='#S5LV0665P0_20041018_GCR_333' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        From my experience, it would not be customary for someone who receives DLA at the middle rate to require care for as few as 20 hours a week. Normally the requirement is much higher than that. Furthermore, how can we achieve recognition in the national insurance system for caring responsibilities where there is no easy audit trail for care of the elderly as there is for children? The carer's hours may fluctuate. One week may include laundry and shopping duties so that 25 hours is spent on care, while during another week the carer may just be popping in for an hour a day, amounting to only five hours. I find it difficult to envisage exactly how it could be calculated. For these various reasons, therefore, I do not think that I can help my noble friend.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0665P0-04735'>

        I turn to Amendment No. 336B. This new clause seeks to allow for the aggregation of earnings below the lower earnings limit for people with a number of paid jobs, thus providing a qualifying earnings factor for both basic and additional state retirement pension.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0665P0-04736'>
        <a class='permalink' href='#S5LV0665P0_20041018_GCR_335' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        Again, we recognise the issue here. Around 60,000 people have total earnings above the LEL for these purposes. most of them women. The crux of the issue which this amendment seeks to address is that liability for national insurance is determined by the level of a person's earnings in an individual employment, as opposed to being able to calculate two jobs together. As a result, a person could he earning well above the LEL and not qualify.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0665P0-04737'>
        <a class='permalink' href='#S5LV0665P0_20041018_GCR_336' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        However, again there would be a number of practical difficulties, such as the need for employers to record more information. Let us take someone who has five different part-time jobs. Would we ask one of those employers to be the nominal employer for these purposes and the other four employers not? In a sense this is a version of the carer's dilemma: at the moment we have an easy option whereby we can follow a paper trail for audit purposes.

        When significant benefits hinge on the robustness of the paper trail, does my noble friend suggest that we should stipulate two employments but not three, or three but not five? Alternatively, would my noble friend pursue an income-related test? That might be sturdier, but even in that case you would still need one of the employers to be responsible for the employer's side of the national insurance contribution. How would that responsibility be spread?

        I suspect that all noble Lords, including myself, are sympathetic to the entire bundle of issues raised here, so many of which are related to women's access to the basic state pension by virtue of some of the anomalies

        that we have inherited from Beveridge. However, I repeat that I do not think that we can address them on a piecemeal basis because each would have knock-on effects. Not only would those be costly and complex, they would often subvert other things that we are seeking to do on the pensions front. Again, as I asked noble Lords earlier today, I would ask my noble friend to await our report on women's pensions due in the forthcoming year.

            I thank my noble friend for her detailed explanation in response to my amendments, which was not at all unexpected. I take the point about carers and making piecemeal changes. In the field of pensions and public policy associated with that, answering one question creates a whole range of others.</p><p>
            In response to the point about aggregation of earnings, on paper her answer is logical and I accept it, but I am still troubled by the fact that if that fictitious woman had three jobs, it would not stop the Inland Revenue deducting income tax from her for each of those jobs. If she was on some kind of family support, it would not stop the welfare system taking into account all the earnings from her three jobs. I accept that it is difficult, but the point is: do people have to fit the system or do we have systems to fit people? We must debate that in considering the whole of the pension system. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

        The noble Baroness said: This is a vast raft of amendments and perhaps I could speak very briefly to them. They are minor, technical amendments. For example, Amendment No. 340AA is a consequential amendment on pensions liberation, which we discussed much earlier. However, I draw the Committee's attention to Amendment No. 344A, in which we agree that there should be parliamentary scrutiny of orders relating to amounts to be raised by pension protection levies. That amendment, partly in response to the Committee's concerns, makes them subject to the affirmative procedure. I am happy to give further examples if the Committee wishes, but, as I said, the amendments are minor, technical and drafting in nature. The only one of substantive

            Clause 287 makes specific provision in relation to staff who transfer from OPRA to the Pensions Regulator. It ensures that the terms and conditions of employment of staff who transfer will be protected, with the transfer expressly being made subject to the provisions of TUPE. However, those TUPE regulations do not protect occupational pension rights. Subsection (2) makes express provision for such rights to be protected. I commend the clause.

            I said that I would not comment on each of the withdrawn amendments, but I must comment on Amendment No. 340C. It was a paving amendment to introduce a new clause, covering the powers of the regulator to require the ring-fencing of assets. That has disappeared as well. One rather wonders what has been going on in the preparation of the Bill. There have been a substantive number of government amendments so far and we have been promised a whole string more on Report, many of which are in response to queries and suggestions made in Committee and earlier. However, to withdraw an entire new clause is more than a little odd. I would like to know the reason for it.

            It is basically because the amendments that we originally envisaged were about the ring-fencing provisions, which have been superseded by the directive. The clause is about scheme rules. It is a little odd to be fished on amendments that are not on the Marshalled List; that is why I pushed the noble Lord on it.
