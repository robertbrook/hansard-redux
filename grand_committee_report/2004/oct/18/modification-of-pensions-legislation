        The noble Baroness said: The new clause introduces regulation-making powers to modify provisions in pensions legislation referring to employers. The clause is consequential to the new definition of occupational pension schemes in Clause 229. In accordance with the European directive on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision, that definition includes provision for the self-employed to join an occupational pension scheme and, for consistency with Inland Revenue provisions in the

            It is a new clause after Clause 293, set out in Amendment No. 342B. It provides the necessary power to modify the provisions in such circumstances, and so avoid placing legislative obligations on an employer, on whom such obligations are clearly inappropriate. In other words, it covers where someone is self-employed or non-employed. We are trying to fit that into the new European directive rules. I beg to move.

The amendment is Amendment No. 342B, and I am speaking also to Amendments Nos. 346ZA, 348EZA and 348EA. Amendment No. 342B is very clearly on my groupings list.

            May I seek help on that? I did not know how the numbering would go. I apologise to the Committee profoundly. The unnumbered amendment should be Amendment No. 342ZB. It is an error on the Marshalled List. We apparently informed the usual channels about it on Friday and corrected it, but it has not been reflected in the printed paper. None the less, I apologise, in so far as our department was at all responsible.

            On a related point, at the beginning of our proceedings, we were rather unhappy about how the actual Bill was printed. That was accepted by the Government and the point was taken for the future. When one has five or more lines on the groupings list, each with eight or so government amendments, it is difficult to keep track of what is happening. It is particularly unfortunate in that one is rather inclined to assume that they are all amendments to specific existing clauses. If some of those amendments were
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_188gc' title='Col. 188GC &mdash; HL Deb 18 October 2004 vol 665 c188GC' name='column_188gc' href='#column_188gc' rel='bookmark'>188GC</a>
            new clauses, it would be extremely helpful if, instead of merely stating that the amendment was a government amendment and numbering it, the Marshalled List called it a new clause. That would draw one's attention to the fact. I think that it is the Government Whips Office that is involved. If that is not pointed out, one is rather inclined to assume that the whole group of amendments applies to later clauses and does not include completely new clauses that have suddenly been shuffled in in the middle.

            I am grateful to the noble Lord. It is true that Amendment No. 342ZB is on the groupings list, but its number is not on the Marshalled List, although the substance of the amendment is. What he asks for would help the Chairman as well as other Members of the Committee.

            Protected items are a matter of some controversy at the moment. I would be inclined to use "privileged items" rather than "protected items". The clause seems to relate only to communications between professional legal advisers. We live in an age of terrorism and so on in which one is obviously concerned about money laundering. It seems pretty difficult in that context for any great money laundering to be going on. I am not sure why communications between advisers other than purely legal advisers&#x2014;for example, accountants, subject always to subsection (4), which states that the protected item must not further a criminal purpose&#x2014;are not in a protected or privileged position. The definition seems very narrow, and I would have thought that the safeguard in subsection (4) would have required it not to be as narrow as it is.

            I am sorry; I thought that the noble Lord said that he was talking about Clause 295. Clause 296 provides that a person is not required to produce, disclose or permit the inspection of information covered by legal professional privilege, which obviously covers lawyers. Such communications made in contemplation of legal proceedings, or in connection with them, are also

            protected. That is not covered if there is intent to further a criminal purpose. The clause replicates provision in the <a href="/acts/financial-services-and-markets-act-2000">Financial Services and Markets Act 2000</a>.</p><p>
            The noble Lord went on to ask why other professional bodies were not covered in the same way as lawyers. As I understand it, there is a longstanding rule on protection of legal advice that could inhibit frank assessment of a person's culpability, legal position and the like. No such protection exists in other legislation for other professionals, such as accountants and actuaries, in the same way, because there is a confidential basis between lawyers and the individual. If I am wrong, I shall write to the noble Lord. If he asked why others should not have it, that would open a much bigger debate, not only for the Bill but for a series of analogous pieces of legislation, including the <a href="/acts/financial-services-and-markets-act-2000">Financial Services and Markets Act</a>.

            Is there a distinction between protected items and privileged items'? I was under the impression that communications between my accountant and me were protected or privileged, whichever expression one likes to use. There has been some change in that in relation to money laundering and so on, but I would not have thought that there was any easy way of getting involved in money laundering so far as the Bill was concerned. Anyway, if there were money laundering, it would be covered by subsection (4) on criminal activity. Am I wrong in thinking that communications between one's accountant and oneself are not privileged in that sense'?

            The noble Lord's original suspicion was right&#x2014;"protected items" is a term in the Bill for describing privileged items in the context of production of certain information to the register and so on. I am advised that, in effect, there is no difference between the use of those two terms in the context of the Bill. However, I really do not want to be pressed on the wider issue of other professionals. Let me take advice on it. Its implications would be extremely wide. We actually require most of the professionals about which we are talking to whistle-blow. so to allow them to protect or privilege information that they have acquired would not seem appropriate. That seems different from a lawyer's privilege, which is normally invoked when he seeks to protect a client against various charges, civil or criminal.

            I encourage the noble Baroness to take advice and, if necessary, to write to us on the matter. There is quite an argument going on at the moment between the accountancy and legal professions on whether they are treated on all fours in certain sorts of tax advice schemes, so the issue is topical.

            matter through. However, as someone who is neither a lawyer nor an accountant, if the accountant comes into information by virtue of his role <span class="italic">vis-a-vis</span> a scheme, we are imposing certain duties on him, given the production of information to the regulator and so on, that seem rather different from those in which a lawyer would be invoked, in terms of protected or privileged information <span class="italic">vis-a-vis</span> a client.

            It is a little late in the day to say more on the discussion that we had earlier, but I have suddenly realised that we have gone all the way through with these enormous groupings of government amendments and they then turn up later on different clauses. We should consider for the future whether or not government amendments should be grouped in this way.</p><p>
            It is of course at the discretion of the Opposition, the Liberal Democrats or whoever to express a view on how their amendments should be grouped but, on looking at the grouping sheet in front of me on which Clause 300 appears, if the amendments in that whole wodge at the top are going to turn up in later clauses, it might perhaps be as well to consider whether or not the principal one should be put at the head of the relevant clause rather than suddenly having them all up front. This, again, is a matter for the Government Whips Office.

            I accept that the way in which the groupings list has been laid out has not been helpful to the proceedings. I absolutely accept that. I think that we have all felt some degree of confusion as to which amendment we were talking about and where. This has not been helped by the acoustics in the room.</p><p>

            The problem, of course, is that there may very well be, for example, a paving amendment in Clause 120 and the substantive debate in Clause 130, but the two have to be grouped in order to make any sense at all. Whether there could be some way of indicating rather more logically the sequential flow while indicating where the substantive debate occurs, I do not know. I shall have to consider the issue. It is difficult to handle the proceedings in this way, but I am quite sure that we have to group across clauses. Otherwise we could never have cross-referential amendments&#x2014;for example, if a new definition cropped up in 17 clauses, we would have to take them all separately. So there are good reasons for grouping across clauses, but I accept that it does not help our onward discussions.

            During the passage of this legislation, as with all previous legislation that we have dealt with together, the noble Baroness has been always immensely helpful in doing everything that she can to get the statutory instruments to us in draft form before the later stages of a Bill. There is an enormous amount of delegated legislation in this Bill and I very much hope that she will let us have the drafts of the statutory instruments&#x2014;at any rate, the main ones with which we are concerned&#x2014;as soon as she reasonably can.

            I agree with the noble Lord. I am advised that we are dealing with more than 100 different sets of regulations. Given that we are in the last day in Committee, I wonder whether it would be helpful if I were to circulate two pieces of paper. The first would set out broadly what government amendments we expect to bring back on report as far as we can so far tell. We may not specify the words but we will outline the content&#x2014;for instance, about moral hazard and so on.</p><p>
            I will also be very happy to prepare, as far as we can, a memorandum setting out the packages of regulations that we expect to introduce and a broad idea of when we may be bringing them to your Lordships' House.

I shall be very happy to ask my officials to undertake that work in the gap between Committee and Report stages so that people will know what the rolling timetable will look like, if the Committee would find that helpful.

        The noble Lord said: As the noble Baroness said, there will be something like 100 different sets of regulations following on from the Bill, 17 of which, at the moment, will be affirmative regulations. My intention is to persuade the noble Baroness that there should be 18.

        Why? My 18th affirmative regulation concerns the changes to or the abandonment of public sector pension schemes. There is an enormous interest in this issue at the moment as virtually any newspaper article which has reported on the effects of the Turner report&#x2014;and, indeed, outside of it&#x2014;has mentioned over the past six weeks or so.

        I cannot imagine that the concerns about this perceived unfairness will go away. Therefore there will be enormous interest immediately any public sector scheme is changed. On that basis, it is only reasonable that there should be a debate in both Houses of Parliament about the issue. Of course, the only way one can guarantee a debate in the Houses of Parliament about a particular subject is for the issue to be enacted by affirmative resolution. I beg to move.

            I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, that in some situations we could be dealing with substantial pension schemes affecting many members.</p><p>
            Let me make two points. First, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did not consider that the regulations associated with this clause should be introduced under the affirmative procedure. We have tried impeccably to follow its recommendations, as we normally do.</p><p>
            Secondly, there is a practical problem. The reason we are concerned about making these regulations affirmative is that it is likely to slow down the process by which public pension schemes can be wound up. That would have the potential to impact adversely on the financial stability of the scheme. In the worst scenario, this could delay the payment of individual pensions. Given that and the occasional urgency of a situation, we believe that they should remain negative.</p><p>
            However, as with other issues on which I have given an undertaking, I am happy to make sure that the Opposition Benches know when we are laying those negative regulations so that if they feel unhappy about it they will be able to pray against them. We can then have a debate and the regulations will not go through without the opportunity for public scrutiny.</p><p>
            Obviously, some of the bigger ones will be debated, but there could be many small changes or modifications with which I would not dream of troubling your Lordships' House&#x2014;for example, in regard to some minor changes to survivor's benefit in a small scheme. It would be absurd to be tied in that way.</p><p>

            If the Committee is happy to leave it to the department's judgment about which are the major issues, I shall be happy to notify noble Lords. But we shall still keep them within the negative framework.

            I find that a rather strange argument. It would be opportunistic, to say the least, if a scheme by negative instrument was laid and the Government did not carry it out until after the praying time. How much would the delay involve?</p><p>
            Secondly, I totally accept that there will be occasions when one public body supersedes another public body for the same purposes&#x2014;for example, as is about to happen where some of the public bodies attached to the Department of Health are to be amalgamated. In such situations it may well be necessary to change pension schemes and I accept the noble Baroness's argument that there is no great need for an affirmative resolution procedure.</p><p>
            But, having said that, I have taken careful note of what the noble Baroness said about giving the Opposition Front Benches notice of when large schemes are likely to be changed, and I am grateful for that.

            If the noble Lord is seriously concerned about this issue and the praying times, I shall be happy to take it away, have a look at it and consider whether we can move on it. I am not yet persuaded, but I shall be happy to take the matter away. There have been so few requests from the Opposition to turn a negative into an affirmative that when points are seriously made I am happy to have another look at the issue.

            I am very grateful. The only other point I wish to make is that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of your Lordships' House, the recommendations of which are slavishly followed by Her Majesty's Government, is not the fount of all wisdom in this area. I am not suggesting that I am a fount of any wisdom in this area. Nevertheless, I do not think that it is a condemnation of a suggestion on statutory instruments that it has not come from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee.</p><p>
            Having said that, I am grateful that the noble Baroness will look at the matter again. In those circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p><p>

            As this clause is about commencement, I cannot resist the temptation to say a word about it as we are about to stop. This has been a very long and prolonged Committee stage, which has been carried out with a determination to improve the Bill as far as possible. We shall certainly try to do so at the Report stage and Third Reading.</p><p>
            It would be ungracious to conclude the proceedings without expressing our thanks to the noble Baroness, who has flown solo, so to speak, throughout the proceedings. She has done everything possible to provide satisfactory answers to the various points that we have raised. I thank the Government Whip who has assisted in our proceedings. But it has been a virtuoso performance and we look forward to massive concessions at later stages of the Bill.

I thank not only the Minister and my noble friend Lady Barker, but the Back-Benchers from other parties&#x2014;some of whom are not in their places&#x2014;who have played a vigorous part in our proceedings, particularly those who are still in their places. It has been a good spirit so far. I am sure that we will return refreshed after a brief holiday.

            I am happy to agree with that, and to thank my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale. I am also inclined, rather like the "Last Night of the Proms", to thank the gallery. It is somewhat depleted this evening, but we have had a massive attendance during the course of our proceedings. The lack of press coverage is something about which I will say nothing.
