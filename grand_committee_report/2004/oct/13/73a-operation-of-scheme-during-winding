        (2) During the winding up period, the trustees or managers of the scheme&#x2014;
        <ol>
        <li>(a) must secure that any pensions or other benefits (other than money purchase benefits) paid to or in respect of a member are reduced, so far as necessary, to reflect the liabilities of the scheme to or in respect of the member which will be satisfied in accordance with section 73, and</li>
        <li>(b) may, for the purposes of paragraph (a), take such steps as they consider appropriate (including steps adjusting future payments) to recover any overpayment or pay any shortfall.</li>

        (6) Where a person is entitled to a pension credit derived from another person's shareable rights under the scheme, subsection (3) does not prevent the trustees or managers of the scheme discharging their liability in respect of the credit under Chapter 1 of Part 4 of the <a href="/acts/welfare-reform-and-pensions-act-1999">Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999</a> (sharing of rights under pension arrangements) by conferring appropriate rights under the scheme on that person.

        (7) Regulations may require the trustees or managers of the scheme, in prescribed circumstances&#x2014;
        <ol>
        <li>(a) to adjust the entitlement of a person to a pension or other benefit under the scheme rules where the entitlement arises as a result of a discretionary award which takes effect during the winding up period;</li>
        <li>(b) to adjust the entitlement of a person ("the survivor") to a pension or other benefit under the scheme rules where&#x2014;</li>
        <ol>
        <li>(i) a member of the scheme, or a person who was (or might have become) entitled to a pension or other benefit in respect of a member, dies during the winding up period, and</li>
        <col>GC 72</col>
        <li>(ii) the survivor's entitlement is to a pension or other benefit in respect of the member (whether arising on the date of that death or subsequently).</li>

        (8) Regulations under subsection (7) may, in particular&#x2014;
        <ol>
        <li>(a) prescribe how the required adjustments to entitlement are to be determined and the manner in which they are to be made;</li>
        <li>(b) in a case where the commencement of the winding up of the scheme is backdated (whether in accordance with section 145 of the <a href="/acts/pensions-act-2004">Pensions Act 2004</a> (requirement to wind up schemes with sufficient assets to meet protected liabilities) or otherwise), require any adjustment to a person's entitlement to be made with effect from the time the award takes effect;</li>
        <li>(c) without prejudice to sections 10(3) to (9), 73B(2) and 116, make provision about the consequences of breaching the requirements of the regulations.</li>

        (9) If the scheme confers power on any person other than the trustees or managers of the scheme to apply the assets of the scheme in respect of pensions or other benefits (including increases in pensions or benefits), it cannot be exercised by that person but may, subject to the provisions made by or by virtue of this section and sections 73 and 73B, be exercised instead by the trustees or managers.

        (10) For the purposes of this section&#x2014;
        <ul>
        <li>"appropriate rights" has the same meaning as in paragraph 5 of Schedule 5 to the <a href="/acts/welfare-reform-and-pensions-act-1999">Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999</a> (pension credits: mode of discharge);</li>

        </ul>
