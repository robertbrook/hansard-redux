            Before I put the question that the Title be postponed, it may be helpful to remind your Lordships of the procedure for today's Committee. Except in one important respect our proceedings will be exactly as in a normal Committee of the Whole House. We shall go through the Bill clause by clause, noble Lords will speak standing, all noble Lords are free to attend, and participate, and the proceedings will be recorded in <span class="italic">Hansard</span>. But the House has agreed there shall be no Divisions in this Committee. Any issue on which agreement cannot be reached should be considered again at the Report stage when, if necessary, a Division may be called. Unless, therefore, an amendment is likely to be agreed to, it should be withdrawn.</p><p>
            I should also explain what will happen if there is a Division in the Chamber while we are sitting. This Committee will adjourn as soon as the Division bells are rung and will resume after 10 minutes.
          </p>

            Perhaps I can explain how the Opposition intend to conduct themselves today. Your Lordships will be aware that we have had many government amendments produced at a very late stage. It has therefore been agreed through the usual channels that this session of the Committee will be one which will hear government amendments.</p><p>
            As far as the Opposition are concerned, I shall be moving the first group on the grouping list, starting with Amendment No. 4, which the Government have agreed and therefore there will be no question of a Division. After that the Opposition will neither move any amendment nor speak to any other amendment moved by a noble Lord.</p><p>
            The object of the exercise, as agreed through the usual channels, is that we get through the government amendments this afternoon, that the Bill should be re-printed tonight and that the Leader of the House will make a business Statement tomorrow indicating that the Bill, revised by the Committee if the government amendments are accepted, is to be re-printed, and that there will be re-commitment of the reprinted Bill, which means that we shall meet again on Thursday with that re-printed Bill before us. That is the Opposition's view, agreed through the usual channels. I would only say one other thing. I am working on the assumption that there will be no more government amendments tabled in the meantime.

            briefly to the noble Lord, Lord Williams. He is absolutely correct. The Government have agreed that, in view of the circumstances, we shall seek to move all government amendments today and that the Bill will be re-committed on Thursday following re-printing.</p><p>

        The noble Earl said: This amendment removes unnecessary words from Clause 2(3), because their effect is achieved by paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 8 to the Bill. Subsection (3) currently provides that men of the volunteer reserve forces will have been listed or re-engaged in those forces. The amendment removes the provision from Clause 2(3) that there will be some men of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force who will have transferred to that force by paragraph 7(2) of Schedule 8. Schedule 8 already makes this provision, so the reference in Clause 2(3) is unnecessary. I beg to move.

        The noble Lord said: I beg to move Amendment No. 4 standing in my name and that of my noble friends Lady Turner of Camden and Lord Judd. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I also speak to Amendments Nos. 5 to 7, 60 and 61. I should emphasise that the amendments following Amendment No. 4 which I have just mentioned are consequential on Amendment No. 4, and therefore if the Committee agrees to Amendment No. 4, provided I am alert enough on my feet to move Amendments Nos. 60 and 61 when they are called, those will be passed.

        This amendment is really quite simple. It seeks to establish parliamentary control of the numbers in the reserve marine forces and put them on the same basis as the Army and Air Force. This amendment, as I understand it, has been agreed by the Government and therefore I hope very much that the Committee will agree to it. I beg to move.

            The Government had already considered whether we should have uniform provisions for controlling the maximum numbers of all the reserve forces. We were initially hesitant in removing a distinction which has been maintained for over 300 years but, having been encouraged by the tabling of this amendment, we gladly support it.</p><p>

        The noble Earl said: Where provisions apply to both officers and men of the reserve force, the general practice throughout the Bill is to refer simply to members of a reserved force, unless there is a specific reason for referring to them separately.

        The noble Earl said: In moving this amendment I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 25, 26, 27 and 28. I believe they are straightforward. Amendment No. 22 is a minor drafting amendment which clarifies the intention in Clause 12 that orders or regulations may make provision concerning discharge.

        Amendment No. 25 omits Clause 12(3) which seems on reflection to be unnecessary. The right to specify conditions is already implicit within orders or regulation

        and does not need to be explicitly expressed in this clause. Amendment No. 26 redrafts Clause 12(4) without changing the intended effect.

        Amendments Nos. 27 and 28 revise Clause 13(5) to include men of any of the reserve forces. This permits subsection (5) to be included among similar provisions relating to orders and regulations under Clause 12. Amendment No. 28 changes the order of clauses under Part II by moving Clause 12 to be after Clause 18. As the part appears, there is no clear progression of events from enlistment through to discharge and this minor change permits these events to be grouped together at the beginning of the part with clauses relating to orders and regulation in a group at the end. I beg to move.

        The noble Earl said: The amendment meets concerns expressed to me by certain noble Lords on the Opposition Benches that the pensions' clause was misleading because possible restrictions on the choice of unit were not given prominence. This redraft rectifies that and improves the drafting of the rest of the clause without significant changes.

        The noble Earl said: In moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 37, 38 and 39. Clause 15 defines the provisions which enable the Defence Council to discharge a man from the reserve forces at any time. The clause is necessary to allow men to be discharged for both routine and exceptional reasons. All these amendments are designed to clarify the discharge provisions under Clause 15. They are straightforward and I hope they will not present any difficulty to the Committee. Amendment No. 36 is a minor drafting amendment. Amendment No. 38 is an improvement on the wording of subsection (4) which provides for a suitable route for appeals against discharge. Two amendments, Amendments Nos. 37 and 39 respectively, remove the existing provision given to commanding officers for discharge, and replace it with a separate new clause. I beg to move.

        The noble Earl said: Amendment No. 46 is a minor drafting amendment relating to the conditions which apply to a man's entitlement to discharge, and in particular the surrender of equipment and other public property. If the word "only" added anything to the sense of subsection (4)(b), it was an unreasonable inference that, say, accidental damage could not be accepted in addition to fair wear and tear. It is better omitted. I beg to move.

        The noble Earl said: With the leave of the Committee, in moving Amendment No. 47 I shall speak to Amendment No. 50, as together they move a provision on discharge from Clause 16 to Clause 17 where it more logically belongs.

        The removal and addition of text means that Clause 17 now provides that a man entitled to discharge under Clause 16 may only be discharged once he is released from permanent or full-time service. Clause 17 had previously applied only to a man who was not in permanent or full-time service. I beg to move.

        The noble Earl said: In moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendments 51 and 52. These amendments are designed to tidy up the text. Amendments Nos. 49 and 52 transfer the substance of Clause 18(1) into Clause 16(6), with some saving of words. Amendment No. 51 is a minor drafting point which clarifies the phrase "that order" in Clause 17(3) by specifying it as a call-out order.

        Clause 16(6) thus now provides that a man entitled to discharge shall be discharged with all convenient speed, although he will continue to be a member of a reserve force until actually discharged.

        Clause 18 provides for the rights of men on being discharged. The removal of the subsection (1) means its scope is slightly narrower, providing that a man serving outside the United Kingdom who is to be discharged is entitled to be returned to the United Kingdom free of charge. It also provides that he would be entitled to free travel, either to the place where he was attested or to his intended place of residence in the United Kingdom. I beg to move.

        The noble Earl said: This amendment paves the way for the collection together into a schedule of the provisions of the Bill relating to members of the reserve forces who have reserve rights to retaining their liabilities under the current legislation. In speaking to this amendment I should also like to speak to Amendments Nos. 65, 97, 117 and 187. The schedule has now been formalised but, in deference to the House and the Committee, it has not yet been tabled.

        when he enters into the two different types of written commitment, whether for a period of full-time service, or for additional duties. In both cases, the changes make it clear that the written commitment is to perform the period of full-time service in the case of Clause 24, and to perform the duties specified for the period or periods specified in the case of Clause 25.

            Regarding Clause 24, I regret that I did not have the opportunity of being at Second Reading. But it is fairly complicated to read through these duties of a reserve forces member. Will he or she be able to be called out by his unit for a purpose of national emergency or disaster somewhat in the same way as the National Guard in the United States? Is that in here or in these amendments? I am just asking for clarification.

        Amendment No. 68 is a minor redrafting amendment. It avoids any inference that, at the point of release from permanent service, Her Majesty should dispense with an individual's services altogether. The new words focus on permanent service as the service from which the individual is released. Amendments Nos. 141 and 165 serve an identical purpose. I beg to move.

        The noble Earl said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I wish also to speak to a number of other amendments; namely, Amendments Nos. 72, 73, 74, 109, 110, 111, 112, 143, 144, 145, 146, 177, 178, 179 and 180. The effect of all these amendments is exactly the same&#x2014;they all remove the word "authorised" from the description of the officers to whom the Secretary of State may delegate his functions. As presently drafted, the Bill provides that the Secretary of State may delegate his powers to authorised officers. Strictly speaking, before the officers concerned have been authorised to exercise the powers the Secretary of State can delegate to them, they are not authorised officers. This implies that the authorisation and delegation are separate processes involving authorisation first, followed by delegation of the appropriate functions. The amendment clarifies that there is no need for the officers concerned to be formally authorised before the Secretary of State can delegate his functions to them. I beg to move.

        influence on whether or not he enters into this special agreement, it is considered that he only needs to obtain the consent of an employer for whom he carries out a significant amount of work. The Bill defines a relevant employer as somebody for whom the reservist works for more than 14 hours a week.

        The Bill provides for regulations to be made to reduce the figure below 14 hours but not to increase it above that figure. Power is also given to make detailed regulations as to whether a particular contract normally involves more than 14 hours work or not.

        The Bill provided for parliamentary control over both sets of regulations through negative resolution procedure. This remains appropriate for the detailed regulations governing the definition of when a particular contract involves 14 hours' service or not. However, the importance of the regulations under subsection (5) which can alter the 14 hours' figure are sufficiently important for the affirmative procedure to apply so that Parliament may have a more ready opportunity to consider their effect on the relationship between the interests of the employer, the reservist and the reserve forces.

This group affects Clauses 38, 39, 42, 46, 48, 50 and 51 and introduces a new clause. The amendments stem from a question raised with me by noble Lords on the Benches opposite about the need for employers of special members to be registered. Having reviewed the provisions, we have concluded that the concept of registration should be removed. In consequence, we have needed to redefine the relationships between the Secretary of State, employers and their employees which bind the provisions of Part V together. These relationships will now set the scope of persons who are eligible to become sponsored reservists. The definition we intend to adopt is the existence of an arrangement between an employer and the Secretary of State. Such arrangements will usually be contracts, but we have not used the term because that will not invariably be the case. In the absence of the concept of registration, we also need to qualify various references to employers and employees throughout Part V. My Lords, contractors who have agreed to arrangements which involve the sponsored reserve concept may wish to engage subcontractors or self-employed persons. Provided that they meet with our

        The noble Earl said: In speaking to Amendment No. 82, I should also like to speak to Amendments Nos. 91, 92, 93 and 95. This group affects Clauses 38 and 39. These amendments stem from a concern that, although signed, employee agreements will not come into force until a date specified in the agreement. That date could well be after the signing, thus creating a period of no obligation on the part of the parties involved. Amendment No. 91 removes from Clause 39(3) the requirement to stipulate the date on which the agreement is to come into force, in order that it may come into force upon signing.

        Amendments Nos. 82 and 92, 93 and 95 are a consequence of this change because when a member of the reserved force became a special member, he was dependent on the date that the agreement came into force. Under the new arrangement this will not always be possible, as in order to be a special member of a reserve force, an employee must&#x2014;if he is not already a member&#x2014;first join the force. I beg to move.

        The noble Earl said: In speaking to Amendment No. 83 I should also like to speak to Amendments Nos. 84 and 96. This group affects Clauses 38 and 41. Amendments Nos. 84 and 96 draw together in Clause 38(3) the provisions on the scope of orders and regulations made under Clause 4 relating to Part V of the Bill, and logically transfer to the same clause the statutory requirement to consult before making certain regulations. For completeness, Amendment No. 84 also adds two new provisions. The first permits regulations to provide special terms and conditions of service applicable to the period between the cessation of a special member's Clause 41(1) liabilities and his discharge from a reserve force. This provision is required to ensure that appropriate terms and conditions of service can apply to a special member immediately his liabilities to be called and to train cease. I should emphasise that the regulations will not be able to create an obligation on him to train or be called out. The second creates an obligation to consult with representatives of the self-employed before making regulations on terms and conditions of service. This is a logical consequence of expressly extending the coverage

        of Part V to the self-employed. These provisions are required to ensure that terms and conditions of service are not too onerous for either special members who are self-employed or for any special member immediately his liabilities to be called out and to train cease. Amendment No. 83 is a minor consequential drafting change. I beg to move.

        The noble Earl said: This amendment adds to Clause 39 provisions applying to the validity of employee agreements in respect of employer's consent, which are similar to those for special agreements in Clause 29(2), provided a person authorised by the Defence Council for the purpose is satisfied that employer consent has been given. Such things as a technical defect in the giving of consent, or, for example, the presentation of a bogus letter purporting to give an employer's consent, will not invalidate the agreement. However, if that were the case the employer would be able to seek to have the agreement terminated.

        The noble Earl said: This amendment inserts a new clause which replaces Clauses 43 to 45. It does not change the substance of the Bill in any way. However, it does simplify greatly the provisions relating to the discharge of special members no longer able to be called out or to train, and those relating to individuals continuing in reserve service as ordinary members when their liabilities cease. In essence, the new clause, which the amendment seeks to insert, provides for the practical effects of Clauses 43 to 45 in a greatly simplified form. The simplification achieved is best appreciated by comparing the amended version of Part V with the original tabled version. I beg to move.

        The noble Earl said: The existing subsection (3) of this clause is less than clear. It has therefore been redrafted. That does not have any substantive effect on the working of the Bill. Subsection (2) allows a reservist who has a liability only to serve in the United Kingdom or an area of the United Kingdom to elect to serve worldwide. The amended subsection (3) makes it clear that if the reservist chooses an election varying his terms of service in this way, they are modified to the extent that the election requires. I beg to move.

        The noble Earl said: In speaking to this amendment, I would also like to speak to Amendments Nos. 123, 130, 131, 136, 137, 152 and 153. These amendments are tabled in the interests of clarity. They do not have any substantive effect on the Bill. The structure of the Bill means that, for consistency, the same changes must be made to four pairs of clauses.

        In each of those clauses there is in the Bill, as drafted, a reference in Clauses 55(6), 57(6) and 71(8) to an order revoking a call-out order, or an order revoking a recall order in the case of 71(8). In each of Clauses 55(6)(a), 57(6)(a), and 71(8)(a), there is a reference to a revocation order. These terms are not defined in the Bill. The amendments simply make it clear that, in each case, the order referred to in each subsection is an order made under Clauses 55(5), 57(5), 59(5) and 71(7) respectively. These clauses deal with call out and recall a nd it is important that their provisions are clear and unambiguous. I therefore commend them to the Committee.

            I wish to refer to the point about call-out at home for emergency service and to ask why it is that under this provision it is Her Majesty the Queen who will make the call-out, whereas elsewhere it is the Secretary of State who does this most tiresome and difficult thing for the reserve forces. Here I see that it is Her Majesty who is referred to. I do not, of course, expect an answer now.

            I believe I can be of help to the noble Earl. The provision to which he refers or for which he is looking is actually contained in Clause 59 of the Bill, which is the provision for the reserve forces to be used in disaster relief and events of that kind. The difference between the two methods of call-out simply reflects the difference in gravity between the two types of event, and Her Majesty's consent is required for the more serious type of event.

        The noble Earl said: In moving this amendment, I should like to speak also to Amendment No. 140. These two amendments need to be made to correct minor errors in the original draft of the Bill. The first amendment merely deletes the word "under" which has been repeated unnecessarily in Clause 61. The second amendment deletes a phrase which was included in error in the same clause. Without the amendment the sense of the subsection is lost. I offer my apologies to the Committee for the error. I beg to move.

        The noble Earl said: In moving this amendment, I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 149, 154, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 181, 188, 189 and 247. Part VII deals with those ex-regular service personnel who are not members of a reserve force but who nevertheless have a liability to recall.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0568P0-03488'>
        <a class='permalink' href='#S5LV0568P0_19960123_GCR_473' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        A man who is liable to recall rejoins the appropriate regular service for the period of permanent service, leaves it at the end of that period and reverts to being a civilian. The term for a man leaving a regular force, whether following a regular service or recall, is "discharge".
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0568P0-03489'>
        <a class='permalink' href='#S5LV0568P0_19960123_GCR_474' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        An officer who is not in a reserve force does not cease to be an officer at the end of a period of permanent service following recall. He remains an officer for as long as his commission persists.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0568P0-03490'>
        <a class='permalink' href='#S5LV0568P0_19960123_GCR_475' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        Accordingly, it is not appropriate to use the term "discharge" for officers. Instead, they are "released from permanent service".
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0568P0-03491'>
        <a class='permalink' href='#S5LV0568P0_19960123_GCR_476' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        The distinction is a technical one. In accordance with the general policy of the Bill, officers and men are, as far as possible, dealt with in a similar manner. The other changes are consequential. It is necessary to have a slightly different definition of "man" in Part VII. I beg to move.

        The noble Earl said: In moving this amendment I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 174, 175, 182, 183 and 248. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that there is appropriate legal authority for the making of regulations for those liable to recall under Part VII. As they are not members of any reserve force, they do not come within the scope of Clause 4. The amendment to Clause 128 is intended to reflect that fact.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0568P0-03541'>
        <a class='permalink' href='#S5LV0568P0_19960123_GCR_526' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        Since Clause 4 cannot apply to those liable to recall, it is necessary to provide an appropriate authority for the making of regulations&#x2014;the Defence Council. As it will be responsible for most of the regulations made for those who are covered by Clause 4, it seems sensible to make it responsible for those not covered by it as well.
      </p>

        The remaining amendments refer to the Defence Council as the appropriate authority for making the regulations concerned, and introduce the words "of any persons" to make it clear that such regulations can only reduce or relax the liability of those persons liable to recall. I beg to move.

            I am forsaking my Trappist vows just for this purpose. In the grouping list issued by the Government Whip's Office, Amendment No. 172 heads a group which includes Amendments Nos. 192 and 193, and I hope very much that the Committee will be guided by that.

            The Chairman is guided by that because he does not recollect that Amendments Nos. 172, 192 or 193 were spoken to when previous amendments were moved, so I suggest that the noble Earl might be good enough to move them. I do not believe he will have too serious trouble.

        The noble Earl said: In moving this amendment, I should like to speak also to Amendments. Nos. 185 and 186. All these amendments ensure that the provision for regulations enabling individuals to seek deferral of or exemption from call-out before acceptance into service is provided for under the required parts of the Bill. These are technical amendments which ensure that the regulations may cover all the possible combinations of call-out and exemptions. Those added here are exemptions under Part IV if exempted or released from call-out under Part VI. I beg to move.

        Clause 82 defines the main scope of the exemption regulations. I believe that Amendments Nos. 190 and 191 to the clause are straightforward and should not present any difficulties.

        Amendment No. 190 is a minor drafting amendment. Amendment No. 191 is more complicated, but again has been made to improve the clause. Its main effect is to permit an individual who is released or discharged after making an application under Clauses 80 or 81 to be Treated for the purposes of Clause 31 as if he had never been accepted into the service. I beg to move.

        The noble Earl said: I am grateful to the Committee for allowing me to depart from the groupings as published. This amendment is introduced to improve the clarity of the Bill by referring explicitly to offences of desertion or absence without leave, rather than only referring back to the appropriate sections of the Service Discipline Acts, and to make some minor consequential changes arising out of the revision of Clause 98, and the insertion of a new Clause 98(a).

        The purpose of the Clause, which is to specify the maximum penalties for offences of desertion or absence without leave, remains unchanged. It also removes the erroneous references to "man" in subsections (1)(a), (b) and (c), and subsection (2) of Clause 99 as drafted. It is the intention that all offences should apply equally to officers and men, and the amended draft reflects this policy by making the offences apply to members of a reserve force. There is no other substantive change.

        The noble Earl said: In speaking to this amendment I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 217 to 220 inclusive and 222 to 225 inclusive. Some of these amendments are consequential to an earlier amendment which made the offences under Clause 98 apply to those liable to recall, as they already did to members of the reserve forces. The other change is in Clause 102 and modifies the clause so that procuring or inciting a member of a reserve force to become an absentee without leave is an offence, as it already is in connection with a deserter. The other amendments make a number of minor drafting changes. I beg to move.

        The noble Earl said: In moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendment No. 230. The omission of the reference to Clause 21 covered by Amendment No. 229 means that Clause 103 applies to training that is required as opposed to voluntary under any clause. The amendment rectifies that. The clarification of the word "fails" in Amendment No. 230 is simply a point of drafting. I beg to move.

        The noble Earl said: This is another small, technical amendment. It takes account of the fact that various classes of case may under service law be disposed of summarily by officers who are not the commanding officer. For minor offences, an officer subordinate to the commanding officer may conduct the proceedings. In some other cases, a superior officer is involved. I beg to move.

            I may have used the wrong expression in connection with the navy. If so, I apologise to my noble friend. However, I believe that the sense of the amendment is clear. It refers to "an officer having power to deal with the case". I was merely trying to clarify what that meant and, if I did so in incorrect naval terms I apologise to the Committee.</p><p>

        The noble Earl said: This is a minor drafting amendment. The associations provide no real support to the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, hence the need to refer to land and air forces. Some support is provided to the reserve naval and marine forces and paragraph (b) provides for this. I beg to move.

        The noble Earl said: Clause 114(2) describes the powers and duties which may be transferred to the TAVRAs and goes on to list these. This amendment revises the ambit of paragraph (a) which provides for the organisation of units of the Territorial Army and Royal Auxiliary Air Force. The amendment revises paragraph (a) so that it provides that the associations shall not be responsible for the organisation of units when on duty as well as when training or in permanent service, which is already provided under paragraph (a). I beg to move.

        The noble Lord said: As I have just completed a happy appointment as Governor of the Isle of Wight I feel that I might take some of your Lordships' time to explain the reasons for the amendment. I was most surprised to see provision made for Deputy Governors to be ex officio members of relevant territorial associations. Your Lordships may be interested to know that Lords, Captains and Governors of the Isle of Wight with similar responsibilities to those of Lord Lieutenants with regard to ensuring loyalty to the Crown and where necessary raising the militia were first appointed by Norman kings in 1066, some 500 years before Lord Lieutenants were introduced by the Tudors. There is some record in the Isle of Wight of Deputy Governors being appointed in the 17th century, but none in this century by either Princess Beatrice, who was Governor for 50 years from the 1890s to her death in the 1940s. or her immediate successor in the 1950s, the Duke of Wellington, or his successor in the sixties and seventies, Lord Mountbatten.

        From studying earlier legislation, it seems to me that the provision for Deputy Governors was formally introduced into law at the request of Viscount Eversley, an ex-Speaker of another place, whose titles died with him. He was the Governor of the Isle of Wight in the 1880s at the time of the passing of the <a href="/acts/militia-act-1882">Militia Act 1882</a> which introduced Deputy Governors in a large way.

        So far as we know in the Isle of Wight, none of the Viscount's successors has found it necessary to implement the provisions of the Act with regard to deputies.

        It seems to me that there is therefore no need for mention in the Bill. It is perhaps of interest' that Governors are appointed by the Queen. They have sometimes been royal persons, sometimes distinguished persons from mainland England and sometimes even islanders like myself. The present Queen takes great personal interest in these appointments and the governorship of the Isle of Wight reverts to the Crown between appointments. That is the case at present, as I retired about a month ago. I beg to move.

            My noble friend Lord Mottistone is an acknowledged and respected champion of the Isle of Wight and having listened to his very cogent argument I am perfectly content on behalf of the Government to accept his amendment. I might add that the reference to the Deputy Governor in this context first appeared in Section 39(4) of the <a href="/acts/territorial-and-reserve-forces-act-1907">Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907</a>, so my noble friend's amendment would achieve a long overdue correction of the statute book on this small, but of course highly significant, point.

            We are corning to the end of this rather extraordinary Committee. I am grateful, if I may say so, to the Chairman for conducting proceedings of a somewhat farcical nature in the way that he has done. I hope now that the Government have a Bill after more than two hours of the Committee's time. I hope the Government now have a Bill that they can seriously put before the Committee. As the Bill has only been in draft for about six months, and in consultation for perhaps longer than that, that of course is an achievement. But I hope very much that on Thursday we can get on to the main business of the Committee which is discussing Opposition and other noble Lords' amendments and arguments to the Government's Bill.

            I am conscious of the number of government amendments and, of course, that is to be regretted, but I also feel that the noble Lord is being a little less than generous in regard to the amendments brought forward specifically at his behest which we have made great efforts to include. While I take his point and I regret the time that this has taken, I do believe that the majority of the amendments which I have moved this afternoon have been of a minor, technical or drafting nature which have been quickly dealt with.</p><p>
            Bill to be reported with amendments.</p><p>
            The Committee adjourned at twenty minutes before six o'clock.
