        The noble and learned Lord said: Amendment No. 162 seeks to ensure that the sheriff should have power to make an exclusion order whether or not the child is at that time residing in the family home. It could, for example, be the case that a child of a non-abusing parent had gone to live with relatives or friends to make sure that the child was safe. It should therefore be possible for the local authority to seek the exclusion of the abuser so that the child and the non-abusing parent can return to the family home. The amendment is a useful addition and I hope it will receive the Committee's support.

        Amendment No. 163 is an associated amendment, which recognises that the child may already have been removed from the family home by, for example, a non-abusing parent to protect the child. I beg to move.

            Perhaps I may ask a question about the definition of "family home" at the top of page 58 of the Bill. It has been my experience in reading previous legislation that the word "curtilage" is often used to cover the surrounding areas. I am just wondering whether between now and the Report stage my noble and learned Friend would consider the possibility of adding that word. That is my only point.

            It certainly is the case that often the word "curtilage" is included and I shall certainly have a look at that. If we were to go one step further forward into Clause 71 and have regard to the things that might be done in terms of such an exclusion order, other than simply entering the house, I suspect it would be possible so to frame the interdict or exclusion that it was an exclusion from more than just the inside of the dwelling house itself and might, for example, include a specified area in the vicinity of the home. It might be, for example, as I am sure the noble Earl will appreciate, that one would want not only to exclude that individual&#x2014;that named person&#x2014;from the garden but possibly from the whole street or indeed even the village.

        The noble Lord said: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I speak also to Amendments Nos. 171, 172, 174, 178, 180 and 182. Apart from

        Amendment No. 171, these amendments insert the words "or children's reporter" after the word "authority" referring to local authority. It has been pointed out that that should be "principal reporter" rather than children's reporter. I accept that the amendment is to that extent defective. The amendments are put down in the hope that the Government will accept the principle that by bringing the principal reporter into play so to speak, there will be another dimension quite apart from the local authority interest. Of course, the reporter is the person who is most likely to have most knowledge of the background to any of the proceedings taking place in respect of exclusion orders.

        Amendment No. 171 relates to the question of the removal of items from the home. It demonstrates the difficulties in the application of provisions relating to the removal of necessary items from the home and is an attempt to broaden and to give flexibility to the removal of, for example, joiner's tools or plumber's tools or whatever they might be, or indeed a lawyer's books, and provides that the person concerned may come back to get them out of the house&#x2014;although they may not have been removed in the first place. I trust that the Government, if not accepting the amendment, will at least look at the principle behind it. I beg to move.

            Again, this is another case where I wonder whether the Government should have included the principal reporter. I had been quite concerned about that myself: I feel he is such an important person.</p><p>
            On Amendment No. 171, it comes to my mind that, supposing the person you wanted to exclude had a hire purchase agreement for, say, a gas cooker, it would be disastrous if that gas cooker were removed because the family concerned would have nothing to cook with. That is where I am rather grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, for having tabled these amendments, because they relate to matters which came to my mind.

            I am a little puzzled by the amendment because, when I read it, I understood the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, to mean that it would enable a chap who was being excluded to take, say, his plumber's tools or whatever with him, or to come and get such tools, but that does not look to me like the effect of it. It looks to me as if his wife, if she did not like him, could refuse him permission to get his tools. I am just a little puzzled and I wonder whether it is possible for the noble Lord to clarify the position.

            I must say that, looking at the wording of the exclusion order with respect to Amendment No. 171, I have a slight difficulty with it myself. But the principle is there and it may very well be that the wife could stop the person removing any other items from the house. The phrase "or other applicant" is rather loose, but the amendment was tabled to ascertain the Government's reaction to it. It may be that the Government take the view that it is not very intelligible, but I hope that it is. The other "other applicant" could be the person who is being excluded, of course, but then that is almost a contradiction in terms. I accept that the amendment is not too happily phrased,
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_122gc' title='Col. 122GC &mdash; HL Deb 13 June 1995 vol 564 c122GC' name='column_122gc' href='#column_122gc' rel='bookmark'>122GC</a>
            but it has been tabled to raise the issue and to obtain a response from the Government.

            While in many respects this amendment is effectively, consequential upon a change that was proposed in Amendment No. 159 which has already been debated, it nevertheless raises an issue of greater substance than is usually the case in consequential amendments.</p><p>
            At the time of the discussion on Amendment No. 159, I indicated our firm view that it would not be appropriate to extend the powers of the reporters because their responsibilities lie totally in the area of children's hearings. Their focus is very much on measures of supervision for the child. To extend the reporter's duty as proposed would be to risk a serious dilution of that focus.</p><p>
            Since the Committee has already agreed that it would not be appropriate to allow the reporter to apply for an exclusion order, it would seem to follow that he should not have a part to play in any of the subsequent proceedings relating to ancillary orders, interdicts, warrants, or powers of arrest. Accordingly, in our view, Amendments Nos. 170, 172, 174, 178, 180 and 182 would not be appropriate.</p><p>
            Amendment No. 171 deserves, possibly, a separate mention. The removal of subsection (2) and, indeed, most of subsection (3) would make what remained of the clause unworkable, since the ejection of the named person and the prevention of his re-entry without permission would no longer be possible. As the noble Lord will appreciate from that explanation, the whole purpose of exclusion orders is thus defeated.</p><p>
            There was some consideration also in the discussion about the matter of the tools of the named person who might be excluded. That matter could be dealt with by the existing provisions of Clause 71(3)(c)(ii) because while that relates to the granting of an interdict, it also allows for a particular exception. It states:
            <q>grant an interdict of any relevant item specified in the interdict from the home, except by virtue of a subsequent order of the sheriff.</q>
            If the tools of a trade, a doctor's black bag or a lawyer's books (or whatever it might be) remained in the house, they could be expressly excluded from the terms of any interdict. With that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will feel that he can withdraw the amendment.

        <q>who is capable of taking responsibility for the provision of appropriate care for the child and any other member of the family who requires such care and who is, or will be, residing in the family home".</q>
        Although in most situations that person will be the spouse or the partner of the abuser, that will not necessarily always be the case. The term "appropriate person" was therefore introduced in recognition of that possibility.

            There is just one matter; having removed the specification of
            <q>any spouse or partner of the named person</q>
            and substituted the words "an appropriate person", may I ask whether the phrase "an appropriate person" will be defined, or are we leaving open the definition depending on the particular circumstances of particular households? It is a matter of information because the new provisions create greater confusion whereas the original terms of the Bill were fairly precise. The phrase "an appropriate person" is very worrying. It may be somewhere in the Bill already&#x2014;if it is, then I apologise for not having seen it&#x2014;but I do not see it in Clause 84. Perhaps the Minister could give that point some consideration.

            The terminology has been adopted deliberately because the make-up of households is potentially almost infinitely variable. It might be, for example, in the ordinary case&#x2014;that is the way the original drafting proceeded&#x2014;that the likelihood would be that it would be a spouse or a partner of the named person who was being excluded who would remain in the house with the child. What is not appreciated is that in some cases an appropriate person might be the grandmother&#x2014;that is the most obvious one to select. But even though she might be a fairly obvious and predictable individual to be the appropriate person to resume or take on the care of the child in such circumstances, it is virtually impossible to predict a finite list. In those circumstances "an appropriate person" is the best terminology to apply.

        The noble and learned Lord said: Amendment No. 173A seeks to limit the extent to which an interdict related to the granting of an exclusion order might affect people other than the named persons. As drafted at present, Clause 71(3)(e) would allow any other person to be named in the interdict and prohibited from taking any step mentioned in the interdict in relation to the child. This would appear to go beyond the reasons for the making of the original order. If there were grounds for any other person to be prohibited through an interdict in this way there would be strong reasons for

        The noble and learned Lord said: This amendment is moved with some reluctance in response to concerns that were raised in another place. The amendments replace the Latin phrase <span class="italic">ex proprio motu</span> in Clause 72 with an equivalent form of words in English. The purpose of this provision, namely to empower a sheriff to attach a power of arrest to an interdict whether or not the local authority has made such an application, ought to be clearer. I am bound to say that I think <span class="italic">ex proprio motu</span> is a perfectly adequate way of putting it but as that seems to have caused some disagreement in another place we have replaced a worthwhile short Latin phrase with extended English terminology.

        The noble Lord said: This is a fairly short amendment. However, it is of some importance and it is raised to discuss the issue of what happens after six months. Clause 73 reads at the moment that after the end of a six months period the exclusion order shall cease, except under the conditions specified in Clause 73 (2) where other steps have been taken to make the exclusion order cease before the expiry of six months.

        If we are looking for flexibility in these matters in relation to the welfare of the child, which has been discussed at length&#x2014;and the amendment, although short, raises the issue&#x2014;what will happen to the child and indeed to the excluded alleged abuser at the end of six months? I am the first to protect the liberty of the subject but it looks as if subsection (1) may be a very restricting subsection. It may be better to build into subsection (1) some qualification that the court can continue the exclusion order beyond six months on cause shown by whoever the person may be. That proposal does not appear to be covered by Clause 73(3) but, if it is, no doubt the noble and learned Lord the Minister will tell me that I am wrong. I know that the clause says over the page,
        <q>vary or recall an exclusion order",</q>
        and so on, but I am not quite satisfied that this is not a "bring the guillotine down" on an exclusion order at the end of six months and, whatever the circumstances may be, the alleged abuser is back home with there being no power to stop him. I wonder whether the noble and learned Lord the Minister has any views on that point. Can he say what Clause 73 really means and what the effect of it will be in the area of exclusion orders. I beg to move.

            I understand the noble Lord's concern and indeed his very proper wish to ensure maximum protection for children in these difficult circumstances. On the other hand, I have very real concerns, which I consider to be equally proper, over introducing open-ended exclusion orders which would run indefinitely until otherwise buried or recalled. That would be the effect of the noble Lord's amendment.</p><p>
            I agree with the noble Lord's construction of Clause 73 (3) that, while variation or recall is permitted, it would not allow for an indefinite extension beyond the six months period of the order.</p><p>
            Having reflected on this very carefully, we have considered that it would be quite inappropriate for public intervention of this type to continue without focus and, indeed, without regulation of property rights. As the noble Lord will recall, it was in the context of the emergency protection of children that such exclusion orders were first proposed for inclusion within our law. It was argued&#x2014;as noble Lords will recollect&#x2014;that this was a much better way in circumstances of emergency protection to care for children rather than have resort to a child protection order, the effect of which would be to remove the child from its home, school and one or more parent. It is in that context that we should regard what we are proposing to do, and I am sure he will recognise that it is also important that we should not leave open-ended the regulation or lack of regulation of property rights.</p><p>
            One of the major difficulties in domestic abuse cases is having the courage to make the first positive step towards resolving the situation. The matter can be much more difficult where children are involved. Our provision is therefore designed to allow public intervention and support in the initial stages, but with a view to the longer-term situation being resolved with, but not necessarily by, the local authority.</p><p>
            I believe that we have struck about the right balance in proposing that orders should lapse after six months at the latest. That gives adequate time for all concerned to address the situation and for necessary steps to be put in hand. If it is clear that the named person continues to be a threat to the remaining parent or partner, that remaining parent or partner could on their own seek an exclusion order, not only for their own protection but also for a child. They could secure that from the sheriff under the <a href="/acts/matrimonial-homes-family-protection-scotland-act-1981">Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981</a> where the named person was the spouse or cohabitant.</p><p>
            As I indicated, I consider that six months seems right, as the noble Lord, with his experience, will appreciate. One possible consequence of the exclusion of a named person from the home is that criminal proceedings might be taken against that person. One would certainly hope that if someone was going to be excluded, those who were responsible for investigation and/or prosecution would have taken some steps to bring matters to a head within a period of six months. The last thing one wants
            
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_127gc' title='Col. 127GC &mdash; HL Deb 13 June 1995 vol 564 c127GC' name='column_127gc' href='#column_127gc' rel='bookmark'>127GC</a>
            is a difficult situation like this carrying on indefinitely without resolution. It would not only be unfair to the named person. I cannot believe that it would be to the benefit of the child in question if no firm decisions were being taken.</p><p>
            I believe that the balance we have struck must be accepted as about right. It provides the necessary support and time to the non-abusing parent or partner to allow him to make important decisions over the child's longer-term interests and security, together with the involvement of the local authority. I hope that with that explanation the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.

            The noble and learned Lord has rather anticipated a point I was going to raise&#x2014;the issue of court proceedings. What happens if the child is the principal witness against the excluded person, as the child is almost bound to be, and the authorities have not ensured that the matter is dealt with within the timescale in Clause 73?</p><p>
            I know that the noble and learned Lord has said that you can apply for an interdict or exclusion order&#x2014;I cannot remember the phase and I do not have the matrimonial proceedings Act before me&#x2014;but we also have the application in the criminal law. So we could have three Acts&#x2014;the <a href="/acts/children-scotland-act-1995">Children (Scotland) Act</a>, the matrimonial proceedings Act and the criminal justice Act 1975, all getting into a terrible fankle, if I can put it that way.</p><p>
            Since this Bill is geared towards the interests of the child, might it not be better to build into the Bill some discretion for the court so that if, on the expiry of the six-month period, proceedings have been raised by the service of a summons, or indeed an indictment in many cases, the exclusion order can be continued within the context of the Bill rather than the burden being placed on the partner or whoever is in charge of the child&#x2014;the appropriate person, as we saw in the previous context, whether it be a grandmother, grandfather or the guardian?</p><p>
            Perhaps the Government will reconsider the amendment, because one can see what could happen. The court could have three different Acts going in different directions. Subject to that, I am sure the Minister's answer will be read with great care by those interested in these matters. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

        will see, Amendment No. 195A, and Amendment No. 222A with which it has been grouped, are substantial amendments. It might be helpful if I take a moment to explain exactly what they contain. They provide a new procedure for the consideration of new evidence after a sheriff has held the grounds for referral to a children's hearing to have been established. The <a href="/acts/social-work-scotland-act-1968">Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968</a> makes no provision for the consideration of new evidence once the grounds for referral have been established. If significant and relevant information comes to light, it is necessary to make use of the <span class="italic">nobile officium</span> and to apply to the Court of Session under an exceptional procedure.

        That is not a satisfactory way to proceed, although it is available as a route of last resort. It was the subject of comment by the Lord President of the Court of Session, the noble and learned Lord Hope of Craighead, in the recent case of the south Ayrshire children. At the Second Reading, I indicated to your Lordships' House that I would be bringing forward amendments to deal with the matter. Your Lordships may recall that in his maiden speech to your Lordships' House, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, indicated his approval of the approach that we proposed to take.

        If there is significant new evidence which would have materially affected the determination of the original application to the sheriff, it is important that there should be an opportunity to consider that evidence. In decisions concerning the welfare of children, it would be wrong to exclude, simply on procedural grounds, significant evidence which might affect an important decision in the life of a child. It is equally important that there should be clear criteria for dealing with potential new evidence to avoid the constant reconsideration of decisions because, if that were to be allowed, it would lead to uncertainty and affect the welfare of the child, which is at the centre of the consideration.

        Our new clause tries to strike the right balance between those two objectives. The clause makes provision for a child or a relevant person, who could most commonly be a parent, to apply to the sheriff for the consideration of new evidence. To qualify as new evidence, the evidence should not have been considered at the original proof hearing before the sheriff; it should be of a significance which might materially have affected the original proof findings; there should also be a reasonable explanation of why the evidence was not given at the original proof hearing; and there is, finally in this respect, a test on the reliability, credibility, and admissibility of the evidence.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0564P0-07370'>

        If the sheriff is not satisfied that any of the claims in relation to the new evidence meet the subsection (3) test, which I have just described, then he will dismiss the application. However, if he is satisfied that the claims do meet the test, having considered the evidence, he will, if satisfied that none of the original grounds is established, discharge the referral to the children's hearing. He may then either terminate the supervision requirement or hold established new ground on the evidence and refer the case to the children's hearing. Alternatively, if he is satisfied that any of the original grounds of referral is established, then he will remit back to the hearing.

        supervision requirement to an abrupt halt may create problems, particularly if the child had been under supervision away from home for a period. The clause therefore makes provision for the sheriff to set a date for the termination of the supervision requirement or vary the requirement so as, in effect, to phase the implementation of his decision. The new clause also provides for the sheriff to direct the local authority to provide supervision and guidance after the termination of the supervision requirement has taken place. The child can, of course, choose whether to accept this support. These elaborated provisions reflect particular difficulties which have, in practice, arisen in the south Ayrshire case to which I referred.

With that somewhat extended but necessary explanation of what is allowed for, I commend these amendments to your Lordships.

            May I again ask a question at this stage? In Clause 80 we have this person called a "reporting officer". I notice that subsection (4) says on page 66 line 17:

        The noble and learned Lord said: Amendment No. 197B and Amendment No. 198, which stands in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, are intended to clarify the relationship between particular provisions of the Bill and Clause 83, and in particular to ensure that children have the right to consent or refuse any medical examination or treatment.

        I can sympathise with the intention behind the noble Lord's amendment, but if his amendment were to be introduced, it would create an absolute right for children to refuse medical examination or treatment against the express direction of the sheriff or in contravention of a condition imposed by a children's hearing. Such a right is entirely appropriate for children who are of sufficient understanding to make an informed decision, but the amendment would extend that right to children of any age&#x2014;down to infants. On reflection, I think that the noble Lord would recognise that would go too far.

        On the other hand, our amendment, Amendment No. 197B, gives the right to consent to or to refuse an examination or treatment required by a supervision requirement only to children who are of sufficient understanding. I think that the noble Lord will recognise that terminology. It is in line with Section 2(4) of the <a href="/acts/age-of-legal-capacity-scotland-act-1991">Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1991</a> which generally extends that right. With that explanation, I invite the Committee to accept Amendment No. 197B. I hope that the noble Lord, given that explanation, will not choose to move his amendment. I suggest that mine is preferable.

            The question of a child's consent to this particular form of treatment is a very delicate one. As I have indicated to the noble and learned Lord the Minister, notwithstanding his amendment, Amendment No. 197B, I would not in any event be moving Amendment No. 198, so the matter can be considered again.</p><p>
            However, I wonder whether the government amendment takes into account the religious beliefs of the child. We talk of the child having "the capacity mentioned"&#x2014;that is, the capacity to give consent&#x2014;but does that take into account the religious or ethnic origin of the child? If it seems that a child requires treatment bur refuses it because he is of a certain religious belief, do the provisions mean the child can withhold consent? Subject to that, I welcome the amendment.

            This is a matter not of the religious conviction, but of whether or not the child can consent. If the child is of sufficient understanding and withholds that consent, then because that decision has been rationally made and understood, in those circumstances the child stands in exactly the same position as would the noble Lord in consenting or withholding consent in relation to a medical treatment.

            Does that cover the position of a child who is asked "Do you understand why you are being asked to do this?" to which the child says, "Yes", and who is then asked, "Do you understand it is necessary for your well-being", and the child says "Yes"?

            questioner asks "Why?", the child may say, "Because I am of a certain religious persuasion. I know it is for my benefit physically, but I cannot give consent because of my religious beliefs". I am just wondering whether we are moving into another difficult area.

            The circumstances in which the noble Lord might decline to consent to medical treatment might be regarded by physicians and by other noble Lords as being, in many senses, irrational, but, provided he had a clear understanding of what he was refusing to consent to, that would be his right. I am saying that in such circumstances, and provided the child is seen to have sufficient understanding, then the child is in much the same position as the adult.</p><p>
            It seems to me that the more critical difficulty in the 1991 Act&#x2014;I do not shrink from it&#x2014;lies in determining whether the child has what might be described in the words of the statute as a "sufficient" understanding.

        The noble and learned Lord said: Part II of the Bill contains a number of provisions for applications and appeals to be made to the sheriff. Some of these provisions contain rule-making powers while others do not. The purpose of this new clause is to ensure that adequate provision is made for all the sheriff court procedure rules necessary to ensure the effective implementation of the provisions of this legislation and, at the same time, to gather all of the provisions for the rules into one clause in the Bill to facilitate reference.
      </p>

        My understanding is that in another place there was the usual complaint made that, where there are such rule-making powers, if they are spread in various places round the Bill it is extremely difficult to draw together any clear appreciation of what is allowed for. That is why this provision is included in this way in the form of a new clause and I certainly anticipate that it will be of great benefit and value to those who wish to know whether or not rules can properly be made in terms of this part of the Bill. I beg to move.

            Grouped with Amendment No. 199 is the amendment to omit subsection (6) of Clause 84, which is the first three lines at the top of page 70. That was my guide to the amendment that I moved in Clause 58 where I started off by saying "at the top of page 70". I wonder in respect of the rules versus regulations problems that I have, whether this clause really deals with all the rules that are made by the courts as compared with regulations by the Secretary of State. I think perhaps the new clause is a better way of doing it and I am quite happy to accept it.</p><p>
            However, I again have a slight problem in that Clause 84, the interpretation clause, ceases to deal with these rules. In view of the amendment already spoken to with Amendment No. 195&#x2014;it is an amendment to Clause 96 at the bottom of page 12 of the Marshalled List which talks about Orders in Council and refers to a number of clauses including Clause 84&#x2014;I wonder whether this new clause which my noble and learned friend Lord Fraser has introduced should not be Clause 83A when we come to it at the end of the day.</p><p>
            As I am referring to that, there are regulations issued by the Secretary of State under Clause 68, mentioned in Amendment No. 206, and I wonder whether Clause 58, which also deals with regulations, should perhaps be included here as well. I know that the Minister has spoken to it but I felt that this was the easiest point at which I could raise these questions.

            What this new clause deals with, as shown by the reference in subsection (1) to Section 32 of the <a href="/acts/sheriff-courts-scotland-act-1971">Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971</a>, are those rules that are made in the Court of Session by the Lord President under acts of sederunt. The provisions contained in Amendment No. 199 are not intended to cover regulations&#x2014;there are other regulations, as the noble Earl appreciates&#x2014;which could be made at the hand of the Secretary of State. The new clause is designed, for acts of sederunt made by the Court of Session.

        The noble and learned Lord said: Amendment No. 199A has grouped with it a number of other amendments, namely Amendments Nos. 218A, 218B and 218C. For any of your Lordships looking at this formidable new clause for the first time, it would seem to be extremely complicated and difficult to follow. It may be helpful if I explain what the amendment does. It provides for technical amendments to the <a href="/acts/legal-aid-scotland-act-1986">Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986</a>. Section 29 of that Act provides for legal aid in certain proceedings relating to children. These are proceedings before the sheriff arising under Part III of the <a href="/acts/social-work-scotland-act-1968">Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968</a> and related appeals. Part II of this Bill replaces and supplements Part III of the 1968 Act. It is therefore necessary to amend Section 29 of the 1986 Act to ensure that procedures in Part II are covered from the legal aid perspective.

        Although this may seem an extensive and elaborate new clause, it should be noted that it begins by saying:
        <q>For section 29 of the <a href="/acts/legal-aid-scotland-act-1986">Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986</a> substitute the following section".</q>
        So in many respects it is a replacement of what is already there. I hope that it will be helpful, as it were in almost a consolidating fashion, for those who have to administer legal aid and understand it to have the new provisions provided in this fashion.

        The noble Lord said: This amendment seeks to expand the definition of a child "in need", which is set out in the Bill at page 69, line 34. In putting forward the amendment, I am in no way being critical of the present definition. I note that the noble and learned Lord the Minister has an amendment, Amendment No. 201, which covers the same area and, indeed, has common ground with four aspects of Amendment No. 200.

        catalogue of parental negligence, abuse and cruelty, as we are learning day by day, week by week and month by month, knows no bounds. Sometimes that is brought about either by a deliberate act of the parent or by ignorance, and indeed, in many cases reflects on the treatment which the parent may have had during his or her own childhood.

        The amendment seeks to broaden the area within which the child in need can be protected and it gives, I hope, greater protection to the child. We know from recent experience that where a child is, for example, lost or abandoned, as set out in the original definition, that can lead to tragic consequences all round&#x2014;to the child and to the parents, and, indeed, in some cases to people who have murdered the particular child or children, as the case may be.

        Paragraph (c) of the amendment gives an umbrella approach to defining a child in need, because obviously one cannot have a universal definition for a child in need. We could be here all night discussing it. We all have our own ideas about what particular circumstances would constitute a child being in need.

        As I say, paragraph (c) of the amendment is an umbrella provision:
        <q>for whatever reason, the person who is or has been caring for him is not safeguarding or promoting, or is not adequately safeguarding or promoting, his welfare".</q>
        That gives a very wide scope to people to take the child into care. For example, if a child is found wandering about in the main street at half-past eleven at night, or a four-year-old is wandering about, it would on the face of it appear not that the child is necessarily lost or abandoned but that the person who should be looking after the child is not promoting its welfare.

        For example, I do not know what the statistics for house fires are in the United Kingdom&#x2014;and we are dealing only with Scotland at the moment&#x2014;but there are parents or so-called parents or guardians who have gone out to the pub and perhaps left four children under the age of 12 in the house and the house then goes up in smoke. The reporting of that kind of situation to the authorities before a tragedy happens is the sort of thing that we need to build into the Bill. That is the general purport behind it.

        As I say, it is impossible to build into legislation every circumstances, but I would hope that an amalgam of the two amendments, Amendments Nos. 200 and 201, might at least give as near universal coverage and protection to the child as legislation can give. With that explanation, I beg to move.

            When we were debating Amendment No. 52 previously, I spoke then, albeit briefly, to Amendment No. 201, which, in our view, is one of the most important amendments to be moved by the Government at this stage of the Bill, knowing as I did that a number of organisations had concerns about the way in which local authority welfare duties were spelt out within Clause 20 as presently drafted. Indeed,
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_140gc' title='Col. 140GC &mdash; HL Deb 13 June 1995 vol 564 c140GC' name='column_140gc' href='#column_140gc' rel='bookmark'>140GC</a>
            such was the knowledge of the concerns expressed that when the Bill was being discussed in another place, undertakings were given that the Government would look again at the scope of the clause.</p><p>
            A number of important adjustments are being made through changes in the definition of "child in need". In Clause 84(4), which is my Amendment No. 201, our revised definition introduces a more child-centred definition of a child in need, and so indicates a positive duty on local authorities to promote the welfare of children in need in their area. The amendment should ensure that no children in need of local authority assistance are prevented by statute from receiving it.</p><p>
            I might say, in relation to Amendment No. 201, that the revised definition is very similar to that in the <a href="/acts/children-act-1989">Children Act 1989</a>. I am confident that the approach we have adopted, which is to place a firm and simple duty on local authorities to promote the welfare of children in their areas who are in need, is one which is very reasonably and properly directed.</p><p>
            I turn to Amendment No. 200 which has a number of features which I should explain to the noble Lord I do not consider are appropriately placed here, although the concerns he expresses in the amendment are perfectly appropriate&#x2014;not least, the references within that definition, which we had also, to those who had been lost or had been abandoned. If the noble Lord cares to look back to Clause 22, he will find there that:
            <q>(1) A local authority shall provide accommodation for any child who, residing or having been found within their area, appears to them to require such provision because&#x2014;
            <ol>
            <li>(a) no-one has parental responsibility for him;</li>
            <li>(b) or he is lost or abandoned".</li>
            </ol>
            </q>
            That would seem to be the more appropriate place to deal with the sets of conditions which, certainly, that local authority should be engaged in.</p><p>
            Another concern I have is that in his amendment one provision is within the definition of being in need. A child is so described if, under paragraph (e),
            <q>he has witnessed the abuse of one parent by the other".</q>
            That really is an extremely wide and potentially very long lasting provision in that a young child, perhaps aged three or four, might have had the undoubtedly unhappy experience of seeing violent abuse by perhaps the father on the child's mother, but it might seem rather startling that that child should continue within the age definition until reaching the age of 16. For that reason, there are difficulties within the noble Lord's amendment. I would suggest that government Amendment No. 201 is preferable. While I would be interested to hear from anyone with an interest in this matter in Scotland about the new definition, my understanding is that there is a general acceptance that what the Government have now introduced is certainly very much wider. I understand that it is generally considered acceptable to those who properly are concerned that local authorities' duties should be appropriately defined. With that somewhat extended explanation, I hope the noble Lord will feel that Amendment No. 200 can be withdrawn.

            abandoned"&#x2014;I am wondering whether "lost" should be qualified in some way because the best parents can lose a child temporarily. A child who has been lost temporarily is not really seriously in need except temporarily. What he needs is to be restored to his family. I wonder whether there ought to be some kind of qualification to discriminate between the child who is totally lost and the child who is temporarily lost.

            I can imagine local authorities the length and breadth of Scotland would be horrified that if every time a child was lost in a park or a shopping plaza they immediately had to assume an indefinite obligation to care for that child because it was lost.</p><p>
            My noble friend makes a good point, but I believe that it is already covered. Clause 22 requires that,
            <q>A local authority shall provide accommodation for any [lost] child who appears to them to require such provision".</q>
            I should have thought that it was part of a local authority's correct approach to such matters if it found a lost child wandering in the streets to see what it could do to return that child to his or her parents without immediately providing accommodation and causing every other agency in the locality to go into top gear. It is a good point, but nevertheless it is covered.

            I am grateful to the Minister for his exposition in these matters, although I can see that in the light of what the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, said we may be dealing in terms of timescale. It may be that Clause 22(1), envisaging the provision of accommodation for children as it is spelt out, is indeed the situation where a child is found wandering on a temporary basis and the local authority has a duty to take him into care until his or her parents have been found.</p><p>
            I fully accept the views expressed by the Minister on the wide range of paragraph (e) in Amendment No. 200. It has no timescale. If I may say so, that is a very valid criticism, but it is meant to indicate where the child has been adversely affected by witnessing abuse of one parent by the other. As the noble and learned Lord knows, some of the amendments are tabled in order to have discussion on these matters. We may be able to widen the definition in terms of long-term need, which is what the term "in need" means. Clause 22(1) certainly does not cover the question of a child in need; it merely covers the question of the provision of accommodation for children. I am not sure that the definition of a child in need sits happily in Clause 22(1). Again, we will note with interest what the Minister said. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

        The noble Earl said: Amendment No. 202ZA and those with which it is grouped are essentially minor amendments to clarify certain aspects in the process through which adoption societies are approved. The first makes clear that an adoption society must be a voluntary organisation. The second amendment allows application for approval of a service which has not yet commenced. The amendment puts beyond any doubt that approval can be given in respect of appropriate new services.

        The third and fourth amendments deal with a change in Section 3(7) of the 1978 Act. The change brings in a degree of flexibility to allow the Secretary of State to approve adoption societies for a period less than three years, the present norm. In view of the declining numbers of adoptions and the possible tendency for societies to specialise in offering particular services, there may be occasions on which it would be appropriate to offer approval for a more limited period. This gives that useful degree of flexibility to the Secretary of State in approving adoption societies. I beg to move.

        The object of the amendment is to prevent unnecessary and undue delay in adoption cases. It gives statutory force to what should be good practice, and what is already in case law in Scotland for courts. Despite good practice and case law, unnecessary delays do occur.

        There has been a case where an adoption petition took between four and six months when the children were already freed, because the sheriff was otherwise occupied and delayed the adoption hearing. There are already two changes to the <a href="/acts/adoption-scotland-act-1978">Adoption (Scotland) Act 1978</a>, covering delay, in Schedule 2, paragraphs 4 and 17, but they do not cover all stages of the adoption process. For instance, paragraph 4 only deals with the stage of actually getting parental consent. Paragraph 17 provides that courts shall draw up timetables, but only in cases where there is a dispute over parental consent. It would not cover unopposed cases.

        The Government, I believe, said that this was better dealt with in rules of court, with timetables. But are they prepared to undertake that the rules of court will provide timetables for all the adoption court cases, not just disputed ones, because delays do occur in unopposed cases? Also, rules of court are no use in preventing deals by adoption agencies. If we cannot have the statutory protection of the amendment, what about an undertaking to provide regulations with timetables?

            I am in no doubt that in moving the amendment the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, has the welfare of children very much at heart. She has demonstrated that. I doubt, however, whether it is necessary to add the subsection to the Bill in the way proposed.</p><p>
            Clause 86 inserts a new Section 6 into the <a href="/acts/adoption-scotland-act-1978">Adoption (Scotland) Act 1978</a> and Section 6(1)(a) makes it quite clear that a court or an adoption agency has to regard the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child concerned as the paramount consideration. I believe we could reasonably expect that the court or the agency is responsibly discharging that duty in relation to a child, to avoid any unnecessary delay.</p><p>
            The message is reinforced elsewhere. Clause 16 also makes it clear that a court should have the welfare of the child as its paramount consideration in making any determination. And, most importantly, Section 1(3) of the 1978 Act requires that the adoption service shall be provided in conjunction with the local authority social work service so that help may be given in a sensible, co-ordinated manner without duplication, omission or avoidable delay.</p><p>
            I believe that there are already adequate safeguards within the legislation but I would add that, as far as

            avoidance of delay by the courts is practicable, I believe it can best be achieved through rules of court. We have listened carefully to the points made by the noble Lady and we will consider her argument on this point. On that basis, I hope she will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

        The noble Earl said: These amendments to Clause 88 are again essentially of a minor nature. Subsection (2) of Clause 88 makes changes in Section 15(1) of the 1978 Act, which deals with adoption by one person. The aim is to ensure that step-parents can be included within the categories of single persons who may adopt. The aim is to remove the need for the natural parent to adopt his or her own child in step-parent adoption cases.

        The noble Lord said: This is an amendment to Clause 94(2) to which the noble Earl, Lord Lindsay, referred in relation to the previous amendment on the inclusion of the Lord Advocate. As drafted, subsection (2) referring to "prescribed" states it,
        <q>shall be exercisable by statutory instrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament".</q>
        It may be an error in draftmanship but I am not sure what the intent is behind the use of the word "either". Amendment No. 203 may also be defective, because it proposes the inclusion of the words:
        <q>and no instrument containing such rules or regulations shall be made unless a draft of the instrument has been before or approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.</q>
        That is meant to imply Houses of Parliament. As Clause 94(2) stands, it means that the regulation could go before another place or this place and would not need to be considered in both. That is the rationale, if I can flatter it with that description, behind this particular amendment. With that explanation, I beg to move.

            If the underlying concern is a lack of notice or consultation on the matters contained in regulation, then I believe that I can reassure the Committee.</p><p>
            We have consulted widely both before and during the passage of the Bill, and we will certainly continue to do so on regulations and guidance following on from it. This has been our practice in the past and it will continue to be so in the future.</p><p>
            I shall ensure that our draftsmanship is right, as we believe it to be. On that basis, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

            I thank the noble Earl for his explanation. Your Lordships may have noticed, as I have, over the past year that in newspapers and indeed in that august body, the BBC, in particular, the word "either" is becoming confused with "each". We get it in various aspects of broadcasting. I wonder whether that is why the word "either" has crept into Clause 94(2) and whether what the draftsman really
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_146gc' title='Col. 146GC &mdash; HL Deb 13 June 1995 vol 564 c146GC' name='column_146gc' href='#column_146gc' rel='bookmark'>146GC</a>
            meant was "each" House of Parliament. However, if the noble Earl the Minister can give me an undertaking that the intention in the use of the word "either" is that it means both Houses of Parliament, then I am quite satisfied with that explanation. But I am not happy that the word "either" should be left here and I am sure that he would add clarity if the word "either" were eliminated and the correct word inserted in its place. With these observations, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

            I must say at the outset that I cannot see the need for this provision to be inserted into the Bill. We have clearly demonstrated over a number of years and on numerous occasions that we are very ready to consult and listen to the views of all relevant parties. The Bill before us today is well informed by such views and well supported for that reason.</p><p>
            The hearing of evidence in the Special Standing Committee was a further demonstration of our willingness to listen. I can assure the Committee that we will continue to consult as frequently on such matters as we have in the past.</p><p>
            The fact that differences of opinion exist in a relatively small number of areas is not as a result of a lack of consultation. It is quite simply that it is not always possible to meet, or indeed reconcile, the expectations of all organisations, which will have their own individual and possibly competing interests to pursue. On that basis, I would ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

            I am well aware that a great deal of consultation takes place. However, as Clause 94 stands at the moment, there is no obligation to have any consultation, so that it is left to the discretion of the Secretary of State at the time whether to consult anyone. I do not know whether the noble Earl the Minister accepts that view. Before I withdraw the amendment, perhaps he would give an indication of the Government's view on that.

        The noble Earl said: These are detailed but, I suggest, useful amendments to Sections 12 and 18 of the <a href="/acts/adoption-scotland-act-1978">Adoption (Scotland) Act 1978</a>. Amendments Nos. 206C, 206K, 206L, 206M and 206P are minor consequential amendments.
      </p>

        Under existing legislation, if a child who is under a supervision requirement is placed for adoption or a court decides that he should be freed for adoption, it is necessary for the children's hearing to review the case before the supervision can be terminated.
      </p>

        Where the supervision requirement arose from a need to protect the child and not because of difficulties with his own behaviour, there would almost certainly be no need for it to continue, given the arrangements being made for the child's adoption. The review hearing in those particular circumstances is an unnecessary bureaucratic step which could be hurtful to the new parents. A similar situation arises in relation to freeing orders.
      </p>

        The amendments ensure that where a court is making an adoption or freeing order and it is clear that there is no continuing need for a supervision requirement, the court has the power to terminate that requirement.

        The noble Earl said: Amendments Nos. 223, 224 and 225 repeal provisions which are no longer appropriate in the light of this Bill. The reference to the <a href="/acts/local-government-scotland-act-1973">Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973</a> reflects the amendments already referred to under Schedule 3, as does the reference to the <a href="/acts/local-government-and-housing-act-1989">Local Government and Housing Act 1989</a>.

        The final amendment to Schedule 4 corrects the references to the <a href="/acts/local-government-etc-scotland-act-1994">Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994</a> and deletes parts of Schedule 3 to that Act which are now overtaken by this Bill. I beg to move.
