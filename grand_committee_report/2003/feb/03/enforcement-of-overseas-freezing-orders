        <span class="member">Lord Bassam of Brighton</span> moved Amendment No. 157:
        <q>Page 67, line 5, leave out "territorial authority" and insert "Secretary of State</q>
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0644P0-01006'>

        The noble Lord said: Amendments Nos. 157 to 161 are technical amendments to paragraph 12 of Schedule 4 and relate to Clause 15(2), which provides that the Secretary of State may refer a request for assistance which relates to fraud to the Director of the Serious Fraud Office. The SFO will have incoming requests for assistance channelled through the Secretary of State. However, as drafted, paragraph 12 of Schedule 4 refers to the "territorial authority", which is inconsistent with the drafting of Clause 15(2). The amendments are designed to put that right.
      </p>
      <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_31gc' title='Col. 31GC &mdash; HL Deb 03 February 2003 vol 644 c31GC' name='column_31gc' href='#column_31gc' rel='bookmark'>31GC</a>

        As to Amendments Nos. 161A to 161E, after consultation with the Ministry of Defence it was concluded that Schedule 4 should be amended to include the deletion of Section 11 of the <a href="/acts/criminal-justice-international-co-operation-act-1990">Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990</a>. That section has the effect of applying to proceedings before service courts the provisions in the Act relating to the service of UK summonses overseas and the transfer of prisoners.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0644P0-01008'>
        <a class='permalink' href='#S5LV0644P0_20030203_GCR_193' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        The reasons for this are the same as those that led to the original Clause 50 of the Bill being withdrawn. Section 11 of the 1990 Act is superfluous given that other current and long-standing arrangements relating to the summons of witnesses operate satisfactorily in this regard for trials by courts martial held in both NATO and non-NATO countries. The ability to relocate a trial by court-martial to a particular state means that there is no necessity for a provision to transfer overseas prisoners to the United Kingdom.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0644P0-01009'>
        <a class='permalink' href='#S5LV0644P0_20030203_GCR_194' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        It has also been concluded that the Bill should amend Section 5 of the <a href="/acts/criminal-justice-international-co-operation-act-1990">Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990</a> to allow service personnel sentenced to imprisonment by courts martial&#x2014;and who will have therefore been dismissed from the Armed Forces&#x2014;to be transferred overseas temporarily to assist in investigations in other countries. If it is not amended, the current provisions of the service discipline Acts could prevent such transfers.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0644P0-01010'>
        <a class='permalink' href='#S5LV0644P0_20030203_GCR_195' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        In addition, an amendment has been introduced to allow the Ministry of Defence to make provisions under the appropriate service legislation equivalent to Section 5 of the 1990 Act for the temporary transfer overseas of service personnel sentenced to detention&#x2014;who remain in the Armed Forces while they serve their sentence of detention to assist with investigations in other countries.
      </p>
      
      <p class='procedural' id='S5LV0644P0-01011'>
        <a class='permalink' href='#S5LV0644P0_20030203_GCR_196' title='Link to this contribution' rel='bookmark'>&sect;</a>
        The amendments seek to amend the various service discipline Acts in turn to permit the temporary transfer overseas of service personnel sentenced to imprisonment&#x2014;who will have been dismissed from the Armed Forces as a result&#x2014;to assist with investigations; and to permit Section 31 of the <a href="/acts/armed-forces-act-1976">Armed Forces Act</a> to be used to make provisions equivalent to Section 5 of the 1990 Act for the temporary transfer overseas of personnel sentenced to detention&#x2014;who will remain in the Armed Forces while they serve their sentence of detention to assist with investigations.

        I hope that that provides a satisfactory explanation of what are essentially technical amendments. They have been brought forward to ensure consistency and, I hope, clarity. I beg to move.
