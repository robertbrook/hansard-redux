        The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 115, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 122, 123, 127, 129 and 130. These are technical amendments. They make changes to Northern Ireland legislation to parallel proposed amendments to existing GB legislation, which are already contained in the schedules to the Bill. In particular, the Food Safety Northern Ireland Order 1991 will be amended to parallel amendments to the <a href="/acts/food-safety-act-1990">Food Safety Act 1990</a> and the Genetically Modified Organisms Northern Ireland Order 1991 to effect changes to the <a href="/acts/environmental-protection-act-1990">Environmental Protection Act 1990</a>. These amendments will ensure that there is a consistent framework of legislation in place across the United Kingdom when the agency is established, whether or not the devolution settlement in Northern Ireland is fully in place. I commend the amendments to the Committee. I beg to move.

        The noble Baroness said: When we discussed the appeals procedures that would be available in various circumstances to those who were aggrieved by actions of the agency, I said that the agency would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, which has always been the intention in the various processes of consultation around this Bill. This amendment makes that fact absolutely clear by adding the agency to the list of bodies covered by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. Given our debates, this is no doubt something that the Committee would wish to endorse and I beg to move.
