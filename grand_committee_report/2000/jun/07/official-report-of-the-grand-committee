            Before I put the Question that the Title be postponed, it may be helpful to remind your Lordships of the procedure for today's Committee stage. Except in one important respect, our proceedings will be exactly as in a normal Committee of the Whole House. We shall go through the Bill clause by clause; noble Lords will speak standing; all noble Lords are free to attend and participate; and the proceedings will be recorded in <span class="italic">Hansard.</span></p><p>
            The one difference is that the House has agreed that there shall be no Divisions in the Grand Committee. Any issue on which agreement cannot be reached should be considered again at the Report stage when, if necessary, a Division may be called. Unless, therefore, an amendment is likely to be agreed to, it should be withdrawn.</p><p>
            I should explain what will happen if there is a Division in the Chamber while we are sitting, although that is an unlikely event today. The Committee will adjourn as soon as the Division Bells are rung and will then resume after 10 minutes.</p><p>
            Title postponed.

            moved Amendment No. 1:
            <q>Page 3, line 3, leave out from beginning to ("this") in line 15.</q>
            The noble and learned Lord said: The purpose of this amendment is to give the new powers of investment to all existing trustees, subject to Clause 6(1)(b) which makes the new general power of investment subject to any restriction or exclusion imposed by the trust instrument or by legislation. Without this amendment there are some in the charity sector, in particular, who would be excluded from the new regime. These include those whose current powers are granted by what the published Bill called "special statutory powers of investment". That might be particular charities or non-charitable trusts governed by an enactment or by subordinate legislation, or those who belong to a class whose powers derive from legislation or who have been granted additional statutory powers. Certain classes of religious and educational charities may have such powers; and charities which are subject to schemes or orders made by the Charity Commission or the Home Secretary
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_2gc' title='Col. 2GC &mdash; HL Deb 07 June 2000 vol 613 c2GC' name='column_2gc' href='#column_2gc' rel='bookmark'>2GC</a>
            under the <a href="/acts/charities-act-1993">Charities Act 1993</a>. We believe that, if the restriction in the published Bill is to be dropped for charitable trusts, it should be dropped for non-charitable trusts as well.</p><p>
            In providing charities and other trusts with wider powers it will not be possible to predict whether or not they will be used appropriately in every case in which they will apply. But there are four factors which, we believe, make the risk acceptable; first, that trustees should have the wider powers that are proposed in the Bill; secondly, the exercise of these powers will be subject to safeguards, including the duty of care; thirdly, the application of the new powers will be subject to any restriction or exclusion in the trust instrument or any enactment; and fourthly, even where the new regime applies, it is for the trustees to determine in the particular circumstances the extent to which it is appropriate to exercise the powers conferred.</p><p>
            The Charity Commission would welcome the introduction of this amendment. I beg to move.

            This is a somewhat unusual Marshalled List in view of the fact that there are 49 amendments down in the name of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and none by anyone else. Speaking for my noble friends and myself, the Committee stage is likely to have a very easy passage today. However, I welcome the continued interest that has been taken in the Bill. I believe that we are happy to support this and all the other amendments tabled on the Marshalled List. I am tempted to suggest that the noble and learned Lord should move them <span class="italic">en bloc</span> but I shall not go quite as far as that.

            Perhaps I may acid to what the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said. The fact that other amendments have not been put down by other Members of the Committee does not reflect any sentiment that the Bill is trivial or not to be carefully considered. I am very grateful for the consultation that we have had from the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor to which I have given very careful thought. Although I am unhappy about some of the provisions in the Bill, on the whole I feel it best that the Bill should go forward and one should not try to delay it by making changes which would, if made at all, have to be somewhat radical. I entirely go along with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in wishing the best of progress to the Committee.

            Perhaps I may trespass on the patience of the Committee simply to say one thing. Although the clause has not been amended, concern has been expressed about whether the words "for any other reason" in Clause 8(1)(c) are wide enough to include the purchase of functional land by charitable trusts for carrying out the purposes of the charity, rather than as an investment; for example, a school buying land to serve as a playing field. For the avoidance of doubt&#x2014;I do not believe that there is doubt&#x2014;let me confirm that we intend the words in the clause to comprehend that meaning.

It ensures that, however a charitable trust comes by land, if it is held as an investment, the trustees may delegate their power of managing, or creating or disposing of an interest in it. This will ensure that in cases where land has been bequeathed to a charity, for example, and is then regarded as an investment, it will not be excluded from the scheme because it was not strictly "acquired" as an investment.</p><p>

            <q>Page 5, line 29, at end insert ("(even if the beneficiary is also a trustee)").</q>
            The noble and learned Lord said: This amendment answers concerns raised from a number of quarters about Clause 12 of the Bill as published. Although as published subsection (1) read with subsection (3) was thought to cover the point, the amendment to subsection (3) makes it abundantly clear that a beneficiary may not be appointed as an agent even if he or she were to be a trustee.</p><p>
            It is possible for trustees to delegate any of their trusts, powers or discretions to a beneficiary under the trust, but not under the power conferred by Clause 11 of the Bill. It can be done only under Section 25 of the <a href="/acts/trustee-act-1925">Trustee Act 1925</a>, as substituted by the <a href="/acts/trustee-delegation-act-1999">Trustee Delegation Act 1999</a>, but the safeguards are very much greater. The delegation has to be made by each trustee by power of attorney. It is restricted to a maximum period of one year and the trustees are strictly liable for the faults of the delegate. I beg to move.</p><p>

            The noble and learned Lord said: By Section 4(2) of the <a href="/acts/settled-land-act-1925">Settled Land Act 1925</a>, the legal estate in settled land is to be held by the tenant for life or the statutory owner. Thus the legal estate can never properly be held by the trustees of the settlement <span class="italic">qua</span> trustees and although it seems that there are good reasons why it should be possible for land, held on a trust of land, to be vested in a nominee, there are no obvious reasons why a nominee would be needed in relation to settled land.</p><p>
            This amendment, therefore, will provide that the power to appoint nominees does not apply to settled land. However, it should still be possible for the proceeds of sale of settled land to be vested in a nominee, as this may be advantageous for the purposes of investment. I beg to move.</p><p>

            The noble and learned Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 6, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 7 and 9. I take them together because they each have the same effect in their respective clauses.</p><p>
            Presently, Clauses 16(3), 17(4)and 18(4) disapply the power to appoint nominees in the case of any trust having a custodian trustee, because the power conferred by the clauses is incompatible with the statutory duties of a custodian trustee under the Public

            <a href="/acts/trustee-act-1906">Trustee Act 1906</a>. The Charity Commission has made the point that trustees should also be deprived of the powers under Clauses 16 and 17 in relation to property which is for the time being vested in the official custodian for charities. This is because Section 22 of the <a href="/acts/charities-act-1993">Charities Act 1993</a> provides that where property is vested in the official custodian in trust for a charity he shall have the same powers, duties and liabilities as a corporation-appointed custodian trustee under Section 4 of the <a href="/acts/public-trustee-act-1906">Public Trustee Act 1906</a>. It would, therefore, be inappropriate for a nominee or custodian to be appointed under the Bill in respect of the relevant property. In addition, where bearer securities are held by the official custodian, there should be no duty to appoint a custodian under Clause 18 of the Bill. I beg to move.</p><p>

            <q>Page 7, line 17, after ("instrument") insert ("or any enactment or provision of subordinate legislation").</q>
            The noble and learned Lord said: With your Lordships' leave I shall speak also to Amendments 11, 12, 23, 26 and 27, with which Amendment No. 8 is grouped. Each of these six amendments has a similar effect in its respective clause.</p><p>
            The amendment to Clause 18(2) ensures that the exception to the requirement in Clause 18(1) to appoint a custodian of bearer securities applies where there is a legislative provision for the trustees to hold or invest in bearer securities without the need to so appoint, as well as applying where there is such a provision in a trust instrument which applies also where the provision is in legislation.</p><p>
            Clause 21 refers to the requirement to review the appointment of agents, nominees and custodians and the extent of the trustees' liability for such appointments under Clause 22 and 23. The amendment to Clause 21(2) ensures that the duty under Clause 21(1) which applies, as the clause is presently drafted, to appointments made under a power granted by a trust instrument, applies also to powers granted in legislation. The amendment to Clause 21(3) ensures that, where the exception to the application of Clauses 22 and 23 arises from inconsistency with a trust instrument, inconsistency with legislation would attract the same exception.</p><p>
            Clause 30 refers to the remuneration of charitable trustees and the amendment to Clause 30(2) adds to the classes of those who may benefit from orders made by the Secretary of State under Clause 30(1), those

            who have been authorised to exercise functions as agent, nominee or custodian by a trust instrument, those so authorised by legislation. The clause already makes provision for those so authorised by legislation, by the Bill or by the trust instrument.</p><p>
            Clause 31 deals with trustees' expenses, and the amendment will ensure that it will apply to those who derive their powers to act as agents, nominee or custodian from legislation as well as those who derive their power from the Bill or the trust instrument.</p><p>
            Clause 32 deals with remuneration of agents, nominees and custodians, and the amendment has the same effect as does that affecting Clause 31. I beg to move.</p><p>

            The noble and learned Lord said: This is another amendment for the avoidance of doubt. It should be possible to be appointed as a nominee or custodian under the Bill only if the proposed appointee is in the business of providing nominee or custodianship services. Subsection (2)(b) is included in the draft in order to cater for the possibility that trustees might wish to set up special purpose vehicles in order to act as their nominees.</p><p>
            However, concern was expressed as to whether the clause as drafted was sufficiently wide to enable trustees to utilise the services of solicitors' nominee companies, which are recognised under rules prepared by the Law Society under Section 9 of the Administration or Justice Act 1985. Where such companies in England and Wales are owned by solicitors, they can only function as recognised bodies within the Solicitors' Incorporated Practice Rules. Therefore we believe that solicitors' nominee companies should be suitable for appointment as nominees or custodians under the Bill and that the clause should be wide enough to allow for this.

That was an unintended consequence of attempting to arrive at a suitable amendment following discussions with the

            The noble and learned Lord said: The amendment clarifies the purpose of this clause of the Bill.

The amendment makes it clear that the trustee will be entitled to remuneration only for the provision of services which are of the type described. I beg to move.

            It is not a question to which I could reasonably expect the Lord Chancellor to respond today, but I want to raise with him the question whether the word "includes" is meant to be different from the word means" as used at the start of the subsection. If so, what is the difference intended to be? I am sure that it is an issue to be discussed outside this room, but it seems to me a germane point.

            moved Amendment No. 25:
            <q>Page 11, line 34, leave out subsection (1) and insert&#x2014;</q>
            <q>("(1) A trustee&#x2014;
            <ol>
            <li>(a) is entitled to be reimbursed from the trust funds, or</li>
            <li>(b) may pay out of the trust funds,</li>
            </ol>
            expenses properly incurred by him when acting on behalf of the trust.").</q>
            The noble and learned Lord said: This amendment tidies up the drafting of Clause 31 and makes provision for a trustee to be reimbursed or paid directly from the trust's funds expenses properly incurred by him when acting on behalf of the trust. It also adds the provision to pay out of the funds and makes it clear that such transactions apply only to expenses incurred personally. I believe that meets the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, at Second Reading. On that basis, I beg to move.

            I am again grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. This point was originally brought to my attention by a colleague at the Chancery Bar, Mr Lynton Tucker.

As published, the schedule referred only to powers derived from the trust instrument. However, that overlooked the fact that trustees may derive relevant powers from other sources such as orders of the court, orders and schemes made by the Charity Commission and from legislation. That being so and the policy that the duty of care should apply to the exercise of all relevant powers, unless specifically excluded by a trust instrument, the amended wording so applies.

        The noble and learned Lord said: As with Amendment No. 37, this amendment is also made for the sake of consistency. As I said in speaking to the previous amendment, as the Bill repeals Section 23 of the <a href="/acts/trustee-act-1925">Trustee Act</a>, with its concept of good faith, this amendment applies the duty of care in an analogous way to Section 22(1) and (3) of the Act, which also gives a power to trustees but, at present, relies on a test of good faith.

            I should like to make a brief intervention. As the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor will, of course, recall, I was very concerned with one of the provisions of Schedule 1; namely, paragraph 5 which allows the possibility of excluding the duty of care that is proposed in Part I of the Bill. At Second Reading on 14th April the noble and learned Lord gave an undertaking that he would shortly make a formal reference to the commission asking it to carry out an appropriate study with its customary thoroughness. That was, of course, in reference to the question of objection clauses.</p><p>
            I am not making any complaint that no reference has yet been made. I realise that this is not the most urgent and important matter on the Lord Chancellor's desk, but I should be grateful for some indication of what "shortly" means in this case, because I would be somewhat concerned if we were to find this matter dragging on past the Summer Recess.

            I can give the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, the assurance that he seeks. The last thing I would desire to do is to have this matter drag on. In fact, we thought that the appropriate course&#x2014;I apologise for not drawing this to the attention of the noble Lord&#x2014;was to await the outcome of the Lords status of the Bill before inviting noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, to whom I specifically address these undertakings, to express their views on

        I begin with an apology. I am very aware that on Second Reading I undertook to give seven days' notice of government amendments. That, of course, was in the spirit in which we have conducted this Bill, and in fact the bulk of those before your Lordships this afternoon were tabled on 24th May. However, these four amendments appear starred on the Marshalled List and were tabled only on Monday last, so I am formally in breach of the undertaking and I trust your Lordships will forgive me.

        These amendments insert back into Schedules 2 and 4 the four items which were removed from the Law Commission draft of the Bill when it was printed and introduced into the House at First Reading. The reason was that it had not been possible at the time to obtain both the consents required from Her Majesty and from the Prince of Wales in their rights of their Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall respectively. These consents are now to hand and these amendments, therefore, replace the removed items. I beg to move.

        In section 94(1) (registered land subject to a trust to be registered in the names of the trustees), at the end insert "or in the name of a nominee appointed under section 16 of the <a href="/acts/trustee-act-2000">Trustee Act 2000</a>".").

        The noble and learned Lord said: Clause 16 of the Bill gives powers to trustees to appoint nominees to act in relation to such trust property as they determine, and requires, at Clause 16(1)(b), that such assets are vested in the person so appointed. This does not sit well with Section 94(1) of the <a href="/acts/land-registration-act-1925">Land Registration Act 1925</a> which requires land which is subject to a trust of land to be registered in the name of the trustees. This amendment makes it possible for such land to be registered in the name of a nominee appointed under Clause 16. I beg to move.
