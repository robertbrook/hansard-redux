            <span class="italic">presented</span> a petition from the Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of Wakefield, praying that the war may be brought to a speedy, successful, and honourable termination. The petitioners expressed the utmost admiration of the undaunted courage displayed by the allied forces at Alma and elsewhere, but regretted that the force in the Crimea was not sufficient to attain the object contemplated by the expedition, the capture of Sebastopol. The petitioners, therefore, prayed that the House would impress on Her Majesty's Government the necessity of bringing all the resources of the country to bear, in order that the war might be brought to a successful and honourable termination. He need not assure their Lordships how fully he concurred in the prayer of the petition, and was glad to find that it was the intention of the Government to prosecute the war vigorously, and send reinforcements as speedily as possible. As he should not be in his place in the House to-morrow, when it was intended to move a Vote of Thanks to
            the army and navy, because he was about to join his regiment in order to induce as many of them as possible to volunteer, and as in that way he would, perhaps, promote the public service more than by making speeches in the House, he begged to take that opportunity of stating that he joined most cordially in admiration of the conduct of Lord Raglan and the British soldiers under his command, who had justly entitled themselves to the Thanks of Parliament and the country. They had had to contend with difficulties which would have tried severely an army of veterans, and he was sure the House and the country would be unanimous in voting them Thanks for their gallant conduct, and for the perseverance, steadiness, and coolness they had exhibited under fire. Lord Raglan had exhibited perseverance, quickness, and coolness under fire&#x2014;which was not surprising &#x2014;and had shown all the abilities of a great general, and he hoped and trusted that Providence would preserve his life, and enable him to come back to England and reap the just reward of his brilliant services. He was anxious also to say a few words respecting their gallant sailors, and he thought the conduct of the officers and seamen in carrying the wounded to the ships, and the hospitality the sick and wounded had received from the captains of those vessels, and the care and attention the medical department of the navy had shown them, really deserved the best thanks of the country. They had been engaged by sea and land, and had done their duty both in the batteries and in the attempt that was made upon the harbour of Sebastopol. He hoped that these officers would not be allowed to suffer any pecuniary loss in consequence of having had so many sick and wounded officers on board. He thought the Government ought to turn its attention to the subject. Many of these officers had not large private fortunes, and should not be allowed to sustain any pecuniary loss. Had the gallant veteran, the Duke of Wellington, been still among them, no doubt he would have risen in his place and said that both the army and navy had done their duty. He hoped the noble Duke (the Duke of Newcastle) would not think he was trenching too much upon the duty of the Government if he said one word about medals. He did not doubt that the Government would give medals for the glorious victories of the Alma and Inkerman; but he must call attention to the fact that hitherto, when medals were given, they
            
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_253' title='Col. 253 &mdash; Deb 14 December 1854 vol 136 c253' name='column_253' href='#column_253' rel='bookmark'>253</a>
            were given only to the survivors. The medals, too, should always be given immediately after the actions. How many of the brave fellows who had stormed the heights of the Alma had since fallen at Inkerman? How they would have rejoiced had they known that their relatives would receive the medals their valour had won. But, under the present regulations, their representatives would have no medal to show that their relatives or children had been engaged in those glorious victories. When he introduced the subject of medals before, he was told that the war had so long ceased that it would be difficult to find out the relatives of the gallant fellows entitled to them; but that difficulty did not exist in the present case. He did not mean to say that the widowed mother, in her deep affliction, would be consoled all at once for the loss of her son by receiving the medal he had so gallantly carried, but when time and religion had soothed those feelings of affliction, she would doubtless receive it as some consolation for her loss. He trusted his noble Friend would not think that he was out of order in calling attention to this subject. The time was gone by when it could be said that the private soldier did not care for a medal&#x2014;they all knew how much he cared for those distinctions he had so gallantly earned. He trusted his noble Friend and the Government would take the matter into their serious consideration, and that those medals would be quickly distributed to the representatives of those who had fallen on the field of battle or died of their wounds, or who had been cut off by those pestilential diseases which unfortunately prevailed in that country.
