            Before we come to the Amendments on the Paper I should like to remind the noble Earl, Lord De La Warr, of a question that I have previously addressed to him as to whether it is the intention of the Government to bring in a Bill dealing with smoke abate-
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_204' title='Col. 204 &mdash; Deb 01 August 1924 vol 59 c204' name='column_204' href='#column_204' rel='bookmark'>204</a>
            ment in Scotland. I may remind the noble Earl that, a year ago, a Bill was introduced for Scotland a few days after the English Bill was presented to the House. They were very moderate Bills&#x2014; probably too moderate. The simplest course now might be for me to move to insert Scotland in this Bill, but there might be disadvantages in that procedure. I hope that the Government do intend to deal with this subject in Scotland, because it is even more pressing there, I think, than in England, by reason of the amount of soft coal that we burn. I do not see why Scotland should be excluded from such remedy as is given to England. The injury done by smoke pollution there in more than one branch of industry is very great.</p><p>
            Probably the best use to which the large amount of waste land in colliery districts could be put is planting, but the value of a silvicultural crop may be diminished by 50 per cent. owing to the prevalence of smoke in the atmosphere. I myself planted 800 acres around collieries, and I am well aware of the effect of this pollution on silviculture. As a matter of fact, this is not merely a Clydeside question. There are parts of Fife where you cannot go into a plantation unless you put on dungarees, and the effect on the trees is even worse than it is upon the clothes. Again, surrounding the towns you have a considerable extent of horticulture and that is probably one of the most important aspects of the land question. That industry is hampered by smoke. I think that pollution by smoke is even a more serious matter than pollution of the rivers. Even agriculture is affected by it, and certainly the stock. I am aware of the strength of the opposition, but I am satisfied from my own experience as provost of an industrial Scottish burgh that great improvement can be effected without any detriment to industry and with great advantage to the public.

            This Bill is an addition to the Public Health Code. Scotland has a separate code from England and therefore a separate Bill for Scotland will have to be introduced. I understand from my right hon. friend the Secretary for Scotland, that this will be done in the autumn.

            the proviso to insert "and in addition thereto the Minister may at any time by Provisional Order include any other process." The noble Lord said: This is a small Amendment to allow new processes to be inserted by Provisional Order so as to give flexibility to the new prevision. Lord Gainford would have moved this Amendment, but he has been called away on business. It is supported by a large number of manufacturers and also by the Smoke Abatement Society, who consider that flexibility is necessary. Even at the present moment, although this Bill has had a certain amount of advertisement, there may be processes which should be brought under it, and particularly one in the pottery industry&#x2014; to which Lord Gainford alluded on Second Reading&#x2014;in which, according to the technical men inside the industry, very highly finished results in a particular kind of pottery cannot be got without adding smoke to the atmosphere. It would be a serious thing to interfere with the trade by suddenly depriving it altogether of the right of putting smoke into the atmosphere. Therefore I move this Amendment. It might be said that new processes could come to Parliament for a new Bill, but that, I think, would be entirely inadmissible in such cases. If it were done by Provisional Order, Parliament could amend or reject it.

            This Bill is already very weak and emasculated, and the Minister is unwilling to accept an Amendment like this which will further weaken it. The Amendment would also cause certain difficulties in administration, and leave the Minister open to be continually approached by every sort of industry urging him to issue a Provisional Order. I might add that as the law is at present no complaints have been received by the Minister. With regard to new industries, if it is proposed that this Amendment should be passed in order to meet the case of new industries, the Ministry considers that it would be very unwise to legislate ahead of them, and that if new industries require some such treatment as this they can be dealt with at the time.

            I am certainly not in favour of weakening the Bill, but I venture to suggest that the point made by Lord Askwith might be met by inserting the word "new" in the place of "other" process. Everybody connected with the existing trade knows perfectly well that there might be some new process, and if the word "new" is inserted I do not see that any harm could be done.

            I would rather like to support what my noble friend has said. The noble Earl who speaks for the Government has told us that no complaint has been received from existing industries, but it is possible that a new industry might come along which would necessitate this Amendment and if you do not have some provision it would necessitate further legislation. Possibly the Government will consider it between now and Report, and endeavour to find some solution.

            moved, in subsection (2) (<span class="italic">e</span>), to leave out "which relate to penalties for non-consumption of their own smoke by furnaces and steam vessels." The noble Lord said: It is a small Amendment, but it is one in which the Chamber of Shipping is very much interested as they feel that the present law fairly deals with the question of steamers and that ship owners already do everything possible to reduce the amount of smoke produced. We all look forward to the day, perhaps not very many years hence, when there will be a great many motor vessels, producing no smoke at all, but the Chamber of Shipping is very much concerned with the wording of the Bill and I hope the Government will see their way to accept the Amendment.

            A rumour has reached me that the Government are inclined to consider this Amendment favourably, and I trust that by the remarks which I am about to make I may induce them to alter

            their decision. I would like to remind the Committee that this question of smoke pollution has been carefully investigated for several years. For two years I sat with a number of other gentlemen on an inter-Departmental Committee, and not a single representative of the shipping interest appeared before us during the whole of that time, nor was any representation made to us with regard to that particular industry. Now, at the eleventh hour, the noble Lord comes and wants his own particular industry to be excluded. This is the third time that the <a href="/bills/smoke-abatement-bill">Smoke Abatement Bill</a> has been introduced by the Government and the first time that any mention of the shipping industry has been made at all, except on the Second Reading of this Bill.</p><p>
            I am not at all influenced by the fears of the noble Lord. I do not think that the modest proposals in this Bill are likely prejudicially to affect the shipping interest to any important extent, and I am fortified in this view by the fact that recently I saw a notice that a shipowner had died leaving over &#x00A3;3,500,000. That does not look as if the shipping industry was in a bad way. I should, however, like to point out the position of shipping at the present moment. I do not know whether it is realised that ocean-going steamships are not liable to prosecution at all, so long as they are in motion. It is only with regard to the case of tugs and small coasting vessels when they are in rivers and in tidal waters, that there is any legislation. Ocean-going ships cannot be proceeded against so long as they are in motion, either coming or going, and, of course, when they get three miles away from this country they can do what they like. The result is that they are only liable to prosecution when they are at anchor or in a port; in other words, in exactly the same position as a manufacturer.</p><p>
            What possible reason is there why they should be exempt? For some reason or other, my noble friend only proposes under his Amendment to exempt the ships in the River Thames, but I submit that there is no sort of reason for making any exemption whatever with regard to this particular industry. If a manufacturer is under certain Regulations with regard to smoke, it is only fair that a steamer in harbour or at anchor should be placed in the same position. The difficulties are no <span class="italic">Lord Newton</span>.

            All our sympathies are with Lord Newton. Unfortunately, the only chance that this Bill has of going through is if it is an agreed measure. As there is a considerable opposition from the shipping trade, the Minister has decided that he will have in some way to meet them. We do it under protest, but the Minister will consider the question of putting down some Amendment on the Report stage.

            The noble Earl says this Bill is more or less an agreed Bill. That is perfectly true. It is an agreed Bill between the persons who are interested in smoke abatement and the Federation of British Industries. That Federation is a. very important body, the most important body of its kind in the country, and I am able to state that they arc against this Amendment. They are quite naturally in favour of the principle that all industries should be treated alike.

            moved, at the end of the clause, to insert the following new subsection: &#x2014;
            <q>(4) Within twenty-four hours after any alleged nuisance has occurred an intimation shall be given to the occupier of the premises in respect of which such nuisance is alleged.</q>
            The noble Lord said: The object is that a notification should be made at once when a nuisance has either been reported or is seen. The present system in most towns would be that
            
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_209' title='Col. 209 &mdash; Deb 01 August 1924 vol 59 c209' name='column_209' href='#column_209' rel='bookmark'>209</a>
            an inspector would either observe or be told of a nuisance; that he would have to report it to the medical officer of Health; that that officer would report it to the local health authorities or the sanitary authorities; that they would refer it to the council; and that the council would tell the clerk to write a letter and the letter presumably would then be written by the clerk, perhaps a month after the nuisance had occurred. It has been found that quick inspection of a nuisance, which is very often due either to carelessness or to an omission which was not intended, will stop it or give the owner the opportunity of abating it, but that if time passes by it is impossible very often to find out how the nuisance arose. As this has been talked of as an agreed Bill I may mention that both the Federation of British Industries and the Smoke Abatement Society are anxious that this subsection should be inserted. It has been tried in a voluntary manner in one or two towns. It might be said that other towns would follow suit, but that has not happened and a mandatory injunction would have a great deal more effect.</p><p>
            In Sheffield, a very smoky town, it is said that the results of such action are good. The major portion of Sheffield lies in a cup and it is a very smoky place. I remember seeing an engraving of a picture which was taken in a smokeless Sheffield when Queen Victoria visited it. The whole of the inhabitants determined that the Queen should not see a smoky Sheffield, and they put out their fires and stopped their blast furnaces for three or four days. So pleased were they with the result that they actually made pictures and engravings of it. I saw one engraving at Messrs. Vickers & Co. If that result could be brought about in a few more towns it would spread throughout the country, people would get the idea of a smokeless atmosphere and this Bill would be far more popular than any other Bill that has been passed by the present Government.

            Perhaps my noble friend will explain how the administrative difficulties would arise. I think after what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Askwith, that this Amendment would be of advantage, especially as the principle has been already tried. As we know, all our local government has grown up on these experiments in different towns, and when they have succeeded they have been embodied in legislation. I do not want to press the Amendment, but perhaps my noble friend will explain a little further. Perhaps the difficulties might be overcome by a further Amendment on the Report Stage. It does seem to me that if there is a large demand for this Amendment something more could be done than issuing a circular to the local authorities.

            It is obviously fair that the earliest possible notice should be given to the occupier of a factory that somebody thinks he has committed a breach of the Act by emitting smoke.

            It is possible that the Amendment might be bettor drafted, but what I think the majority of your Lordships really wish is that there should be something on the face of the Act of Parliament placing an obligation upon the requisite authority to give information as to the nuisance as soon as possible. The noble Earl opposite says that he will see that a circular is issued by the Government Department. Clearly that is not sufficient. We want something in the Bill itself. If the noble Earl would go a step further and say that, acting in the spirit of my noble friend's Amendment, he will do his best to frame words which will carry it out, that will be quite a different answer and we can put the words in on the Report stage.

            I think that might be done. We do not want to have a contentious Bill here. Everyone is agreed, I think, that the suggestion the noble Marquess has made ought to be accepted, and we accept it.

            moved, in subsection (1), to leave out "black." The noble Lord said: This is really a very important Amendment. I am sorry to be obliged to move it because I thought we had converted the Government to our view. It is difficult to prosecute anybody under the existing law, and the difficulty has been enormously enhanced owing to the fact that you have to show that the smoke is black. That, apparently, is an extremely difficult thing to do. I dare say there are noble Lords present who recollect a test case&#x2014;the case of the Lots-road Power Station&#x2014;where enormous trouble was taken to fight the point and it was lost because, the magistrate could not be convinced that the smoke complained of was black. It must be obvious to everybody that smoke can be equally objectionable even if it is not black. Whether it is dark grey, or brown, or green, or any colour of the rainbow, smoke is objectionable in any form.</p><p>
            What is the sense, therefore, of leaving that word in? This is a new Bill and is by way of amending the law. Black smoke is already a nuisance. It is already a thing upon which you can prosecute. What is the good of sticking to that particular point in this Bill? The result of including the word "black" is not only that prosecutions fail but that local authorities are very reluctant to prosecute. It is no good their making by-laws if the by-laws are liable to be nullified by an absurdity of this kind. I think my noble friend Lord Novar will corroborate me when I say that I do not think the word "black," in reference to smoke, occurs in the Scottish Health Acts at all. It is plain that you ought to be able to proceed against persons if the smoke is objectionable, and not simply because it is black. Unless this point is made clear it will be impossible to get local authorities to make bylaws and more impossible still to induce them to enforce those by-laws. In these circumstances I move the Amendment and I shall certainly divide the Committee upon it.

            standards for any kind of smoke. It is agreed on all hands that no way has yet been discovered of fixing standards for smoke other than black smoke. Therefore, on general grounds it is obviously undesirable to include in a Bill provisions that cannot be enforced. It does not add to the effect of the law if it contains provisions which cannot be enforced.

            There certainly is no reference to "black" smoke in the Bill which I had the honour of presenting to your Lordships' House last year. "Smoke" was defined in that Bill as including soot, ash, grit and gritty particles. There was not a word about black smoke, and I am satisfied that the local authority would have great trouble in establishing that smoke was black or otherwise. As the noble Lord, Lord Newton, has said, smoke is just as offensive when it is not perfectly black as it is when it is of the blackest possible colour.

        It is understood that the objection to giving this power to the City is that it is intended that the by-law powers shall comprehensively cover large areas. There is little in this objection as regards the City, because all by-laws by whomsoever made have to be approved by the Minister of Health. He would, therefore, see that those made by the Corporation were not inconsistent with those made by the London County Council. As a matter of fact, in practice, in all cases of the making of by-laws and regulations, it is for the Corporation to see what by-laws and regulations the County Council make, and then for the City to base their by-laws and regulations upon them, with such alterations and additions as may be essential. I venture to direct the attention of the House to some of the more important measures under which the Corporation have statutory independence for the City&#x2014;Public Health (London) Acts, Weights and Measures Acts, Explosive Acts, Shop Acts, Locomotives on Highways Acts, Advertisement Regulations Acts, Children Acts, and also, under the London County Council General Powers Acts, in respect of the following matters&#x2014;employment agencies, sanitary provisions and massage establishments. I hope that the noble Earl, after hearing this explanation, may be able to see his way to accept this Amendment.

            moved, after Clause 2, to insert the following new clause:</p><p>
            <span class="italic">Chimneys possessed by Government Departments, public bodies and local authorities subject to Act.</span>
            <q>&#x2026; Notwithstanding the common law or any provision in any local or public Act, all Government Departments, public bodies and local authorities possessing works from the chimneys of which smoke is emitted shall be subject to this Act: Provided that in the case of Government Departments the person in control of the branch of the department from which the smoke- is emitted shall be deemed to be the person by whose act, default or sufferance the nuisance, if any, arises or continues.</q>
            The noble Lord said: I do not like to be disrespectful of a Government measure, but it does seem to me a piece of monumental impudence to bring in a Bill dealing with a social evil and to exempt all Government establishments from the proposed penalties. It is almost as if you were to suggest that no person in Government employ should be prosecuted if he got drunk. The case is all the worse when you reflect that the present Government, as we have been told, intend to monopolise all the industries in the country&#x2014;that is, supposing the industries are still going on after a, certain number of years. Consequently the whole of the industries of the country will be exempted, unless this Amendment is carried, from any penalties for producing smoke. Before the Committee there appeared most important witnesses from Government Departments, and they were more insistent than any one else upon the necessity of some alteration in the law. Now it is calmly proposed that Government establishments shall act precisely as they please, whereas every private manufacturer or merchant is to he heavily fined. I do not think it is really necessary to labour the point. I am sure it is a common-sense question, and that this Amendment will be adopted.

            It is unnecessary to attempt, amongst so many distinguished lawyers, to argue that this Amendment is constitutionally impossible. Perhaps I might give the noble Lord an example of the difficulty. A nuisance may be due to a constructional fault, and the person in charge may have no authority to spend money on structural changes without getting central authority. Further, the consent of the Treasury may be required, and even of Parliament. Is Parliament to be brought before a magistrate if an estimate has been placed before it and has not been passed? Of course not. The responsible Minister can, however, always be brought to book in Parliament. There is, however, no intention of not bringing Government establishments up to the standard, and the Minister is prepared to try to form some sort of declaration that could be inserted in the Bill.

            The Government must realise that a reply that this cannot be done will not satisfy your Lordships. It is clear that it must be done. You cannot exempt a Government establishment. I am not going into the constitutional question, for we are much too pressed for time to go into that, but I would assure the noble Earl that the Government will do well to be provided at any rate with words on the next stage of the Bill. I am certain that neither this House nor another place would endure to have Government establishments exempt.

            The result of this will be that whenever there is a little smoke coming out of a private house, if your cook has allowed a little fat to drop in the fire, you will have a visit from an inspector, and will be hauled before a magistrate, your time will be wasted and you will probably be fined half a crown or something of that sort. I hope we are still going to have a little liberty left to us in this country. I appeal to the noble Lord&#x2014;I nearly always support him&#x2014;to withdraw this Amendment. It is really going too far.

            objecting to any change for the better. I have no doubt he thinks it much more economical and desirable that a housemaid should carry a coal scuttle up to the third or fourth floor rather than there should be a gas fire. As a matter of fact, that person will not be liable to prosecution because the Amendment only applies to new buildings. All I suggest is that local authorities should be authorised to make by-laws with regard to smoke abatement appliances in new buildings. It is purely optional, and I should have thought there was no harm in it whatever.

            That makes a little difference certainly, but I am not sure that it makes any great difference. The noble Lord says that he does not want a housemaid to carry a coal scuttle up three or four floors. He says there should be a gas fire. I have always believed that this was a free country, and if I want to have a coal fire there is no reason why the noble Lord should come and tell me that I must have a gas fire simply because he likes a gas fire. We are going back to the days when nobody could do anything at all without the consent of some official. I do not like the Amendment, and I am astonished the Government should have accepted it in such an easy way.
