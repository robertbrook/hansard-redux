        Report from the Special Orders Committee, That they have examined the Special Orders as required by the Standing Orders of the House; that they have considered reports of the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee, dated 24th February, 1938, made in accordance with Section 59 of the <a href="/acts/unemployment-insurance-act-1935">Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935</a>, and Section 8 of the <a href="/acts/unemployment-insurance-agriculture-act-1936">Unemployment Insurance (Agriculture) Act, 1936</a>, on the financial condition of the Unemployment Fund on 31st December, 1937; that in their opinion the provisions of the Orders raise important questions of policy and principle; that they comply with the terms of the <a href="/acts/unemployment-insurance-act-1935">Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935</a>, under which the Orders are submitted for approval; that the Orders are founded on precedent, inasmuch as Orders of this character have already been submitted for the approval of Parliament under Section 59 of the <a href="/acts/unemployment-insurance-act-1935">Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935</a>; that in the opinion of the Committee the Orders cannot be passed by the House without special attention, but that no further inquiry is necessary before the House proceeds to a decision on the Resolutions to approve the said Orders:
