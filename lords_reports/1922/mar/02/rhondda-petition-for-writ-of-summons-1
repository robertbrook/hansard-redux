        <ol class="hide_numbering">
        <li>1. That by Letters Patent, dated the 19th day of June, 1918, the Right Honourable David Alfred Baron Rhondda was created Viscount Rhondda of Llanwern in the County of Monmouth with special remainder in default of issue male to his only daughter the Petitioner, Margaret Haig Mackworth, wife of Sir Humphrey Mackworth, Baronet, and the heirs male of her body;</li>
        <li>2. That the said Viscount Rhondda died on the 3rd July, 1918, without having had issue male whereupon the said Margaret Haig Mackworth succeeded to the title and dignity of Viscountess Rhondda of Llanwern aforesaid;</li>
        
        <col>287</col>
        <li>3. That but for the disqualification existing by reason of her sex the said Viscountess Rhondda would upon her succession to the said dignity have been entitled to receive a Writ of Summons to Parliament in right of the said dignity and to take her seat in Parliament accordingly;</li>
        <li>4. That the effect of the <a href="/acts/sex-disqualification-removal-act-1919">Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, 1919</a>, was to remove such disqualification, and that upon the passing of the said Act the said Viscountess Rhondda became entitled to receive a Writ of Summons to Parliament;</li>
        <li>5. That it is desirable that this House should humbly beseech His Majesty that a Writ of Summons to Parliament may be sent to the said Viscountess Rhondda:</li>
