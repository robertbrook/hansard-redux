I should like to take this opportunity of recording the appreciation of the Committee for the help which they have received from the officials of His Majesty's Office of Works in connection with several matters which have arisen in the course of their deliberations. I should add that formal sanction has been given by the Lord Great Chamberlain, so that in view of the progress which I have been able to describe, I trust that nothing will now arise to prevent the completion and erection of the Memorial by the end of the present year." title='1914â€“1919' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords_reports/1931/jul/30/1914-1919'></outline>

It is impossible to say at what time, but that is the best arrangement which I have been able to come to up to the present.&lt;br/&gt;VISCOUNT HAILSHAM: I take it that there is nothing except formal business to be disposed of&amp;#x2014;that we shall be waiting for the Appropriation Bill and then passing it through all its stages?&lt;br/&gt;LORD MARLEY: That is so.&lt;br/&gt;House adjourned at twenty-eight minutes before five o'clock." title="TO-MORROW'S SITTING." type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords_reports/1931/jul/30/to-morrows-sitting'></outline>
