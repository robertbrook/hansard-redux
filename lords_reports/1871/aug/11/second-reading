The first was to enable troops to pass over lands in certain portions of the country, to be determined by a consultative commission composed of the Lords Lieutenant and Members of Parliament for those divisions of the counties of Hants, Berks, and Surrey which were affected.

The provisions as to lands would last till the 1st of October, and those as to compensation till the 1st of June next.
