            hoped to receive from the Government a satisfactory reply to two Questions which he was about to put. The first related to the water supply of the Metropolis. In respect to this question the reasons were very urgent why Government should come forward to devise some means of rescue from the irresponsible power under which the Metropolis was supplied at present. Everyone&#x2014;at least, everyone who had ever sat in Parliament&#x2014;must be aware of the great power of the metropolitan water companies, and of the necessity of relieving the inhabitants from the inconveniences which resulted from it. It would be remembered that a few years ago, when Lord Derby's Administration came into power, a Commission was appointed to inquire into the sources of supply and administration of the companies, and they made an admirable and exhaustive Report; but no action had yet been taken upon it. And it was the more necessary that something should be done, because not only was there need for a much larger supply of water, but there were sources of corruption and mischief in the supply

            which we had, and therefore it had become necessary to take great care, lest the evil should extend over the whole population. He believed he might safely say that there was scarcely a pint of water in London which was not distinctly unhealthy, and that a great deal was positively unsafe. The water supplied by the companies was by no means so vigilantly watched as it ought to be, and as to the wells, there was scarcely a single well in all London from which might be drawn with safety water conducive to health. It had been discovered by recent operations that the favourite pumps&#x2014;the pump in Old Broad Street and that in the Temple, which he was told had been resorted to by everybody for the clearness, coolness, and excellence of the water&#x2014;were now shut up, the wells having been found to contain deleterious matter. All sanitary authorities held that more mischief to the human constitution accrued from bad water than from bad food, clothing, or lodging. It was necessary, therefore, as the population increased, to direct attention to this important ingredient of health and happiness. There was scarcely a great town in the kingdom which was not better provided with water than London. Glasgow, Greenock, Manchester, and Sheffield were all provided with ample reservoirs, containing abundance of water of the highest quality, there being no stint in its use by the people, and no possibility, so pure were the sources, of any deleterious particles getting into it. He hoped to hear, therefore, that it was the intention of the Government to enter upon the question at the earliest period, and not to leave us for another year in a state of panic at the approach of cholera, and at the water supply of 4,000,000 of people being most questionable in many cases and deadly in others. He also hoped to hear that they would deal with the truck system, which affected, he believed, nearly 500,000 persons. When sitting in the House of Commons he was Chairman of a Committee which went deeply into the subject, and saw what an abomination the system was, financially, physically, and morally. He believed a Bill could not be brought in which would give greater contentment than one regulating this system, and making it imperative that wages should be paid in the coin of the Realm. From all he had seen and read of the system,

            he was convinced that nothing tended more to make property and capital odious than this did. The noble Earl then asked Her Majesty's Ministers, Whether it is their intention next Session to bring in measures for the Water Supply and for the abolition and regulation of the Truck System?

            , in reply, agreed with his noble Friend as to the importance of a supply of pure water to the Metropolis. A Bill on the subject was introduced this Session into the House of Commons and referred to a Select Committee, which reported a Bill at present before your Lordships. It was not in all respects a satisfactory one, and would not in all points effect the important objects referred to by the noble Earl; but he hoped it would pass this Session, as it would at least insure a continuous supply of water. It would certainly be very desirable in the course of next Session to introduce a Bill, giving far greater powers for insuring a constant and abundant supply of pure water to the Metropolis. As to the truck system, the noble Earl was aware that it was already quite illegal. A Commission had recommended much more stringent provisions, and a Bill had been prepared at the Home Office to give effect to their considerations; but, as had been the case with many other measures, the time occupied by the House of Commons in discussion had prevented its being proceeded with. It was intended, however, to introduce it into Parliament early next Session.
