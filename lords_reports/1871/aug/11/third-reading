            said, that application was made to him some months since by a certain number of freeholders in the county of Essex, in the usual form, for a writ for the election of persons to fill up vacancies in the Court of Verderers. The writ was issued as a matter of right. It was not in the power of the Government to take any proceedings to stop the action of the Court, nor was it possible for them to introduce a clause to that effect into this Bill, because the rights to be affected by the existence or non-existence of the Court of Verderers were in the nature of private rights which could not be properly interfered with except by Bills of which notices usual in such cases had been given. Inasmuch, however, as the Commissioners under this Bill would have powers largely exceeding those vested in the Court of Verderers, he trusted that those who were interested in the Forest would see that it was reasonable that there should not be two authorities taking proceedings upon the same subject during the same period of time. It would probably, therefore, be thought reasonable that whilst the inquiry was going on by the Commissioners the action of the Verderers should be suspended.
