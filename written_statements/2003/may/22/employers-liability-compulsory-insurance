          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0405P0-05509">In a written statement on 12 December I announced the start of the review of Employers' Liability Compulsory Insurance and the terms of reference of the review:</p><p id="S6CV0405P0-05510">"The purpose of this review is to assess the case for reforming ELCI and, if such a case is demonstrated, to identify the objectives and options for such reform. Its terms of reference are to:
          <q>Survey the operation of Employer's Liability Compulsory Insurance (ELCI), taking into account any relevant aspects of the state benefits systems.</q>
          <q>Assess the scale and nature of the current difficulties being experienced in relation to ELCI, in particular the extent to which these difficulties are likely to be short-term only, repeated in the future or permanent.</q>

This sets out our preliminary findings in what has proved to be a complex area and also sets out a work plan for producing a further report. Hon Members may also be aware that the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has been conducting a fact-finding study into the UK Liability Insurance market.

          employers' liability insurance, and examining why premiums have recently increased and the way in which this market is working.</p><p id="S6CV0405P0-05513">Although the two reviews are separate they consider related issues. I have therefore agreed with OFT that it would be sensible to co-ordinate publication of the two reports. This will happen immediately following recess, on 3 June.</p>
