          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0401P0-04943">Reform of the justice system is one of this Government's priorities. Since 1997 we have implemented major improvements in the criminal and civil courts. In 2000 the Lord Chancellor asked Sir Andrew Leggatt to review the tribunal system. We published Sir Andrew's radical blueprint for reform&#x2014;"Tribunals for Users: One System, One Service"&#x2014;in August 2001.</p><p id="S6CV0401P0-04944">Since then the Government have been determining how best to meet the challenge set by Sir Andrew. We have taken a wide range of views, including through a formal consultation exercise. A summary of the responses to that consultation has now been published; a copy has been placed in the Library of the House and it has been published on my Department's website at <span class="underline">www.lcd.gov.uk/civil/tribunals.htm</span></p><p id="S6CV0401P0-04945">The Government have decided that the best way to take tribunal reform forward is to bring most non-devolved central Government tribunals together into a single service. The service will reflect the needs and specialisms of individual jurisdictions and will in particular respect the differences between party v. party and citizen <span class="italic">v.</span> state tribunals. It will be a distinct part of the justice system, accountable to the Lord Chancellor. Initially the new service will be based on the ten largest tribunals. Of these, the Immigration Appellate Authorities, the Office of the Social Security and Child Support Commission, the Tax Appeals Tribunals, the Pension Appeals Tribunal, and the Lands Tribunal already form part of my Department. The Appeals Service, Employment Tribunals, Mental Health Review Tribunal, Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal, and Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeal Panel will transfer to the LCD over the period 2004&#x2013;05 to2007&#x2013;8 from their current parent Departments. Where appropriate, other smaller tribunals will also join the new service. The Government will publish a White Paper later this year on the reform and modernisation of the tribunals justice system within an increasingly unified tribunals service.</p>
