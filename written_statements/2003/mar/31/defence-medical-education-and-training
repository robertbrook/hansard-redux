          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0402P0-05083">In line with the recommendation of the Medical Quinquennial Review (MQR), which I announced on 11 April 2002, the Defence Medical Education and Training Agency (DMETA) will be established on 1 April 2003. I will arrange for copies of the new Agency's Framework Document, Corporate Plan and Key Targets for 2003&#x2013;2004 to be placed in the Library of both Houses. The Chief Executive for DMETA will be Rear Admiral Peter Kidner.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05084">On formation, the new Agency will subsume the existing Defence Medical Training Organisation (DMTO). The Defence Secondary Care Agency (DSCA) will be disestablished on 31 March 2003 with its

          responsibility for training and placement of Service medical personnel transferring to DMETA. Responsibility for commissioning secondary care for Service personnel will transfer to a new Healthcare Directorate within the Defence Medical Services Department (DMSD), formerly the Surgeon General's Department. The overseas hospitals in Cyprus and Gibraltar will transfer to the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) by 1 April 2005, but during the interim period DMSD will have responsibility.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05085">DMETA will make available nominated Secondary Care personnel for deployments and exercises, and deliver appropriate medical, dental and military training and education to specified standards to meet the operational requirement. It will bring together Defence medical education and training including the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM), the Defence Deanery., the five Ministry of Defence Hospital Units and the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05086">Key Targets have been set for 2003&#x2013;04 to provide a. balanced, challenging but achievable package covering the full range of DMETA's areas of business. These are:</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05087">DEFENCE MEDICAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING AGENCY&#x2014;KEY TARGETS FOR FINANCIAL YEAR 2003&#x2013;04</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05088">Key Target 1&#x2014;Deployable Personnel</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05089">To meet 100 per cent. of the Commander in Chiefs' requirement for Secondary Care personnel for operational deployments, major exercises and collective training.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05090">Key Target 2&#x2014;Training Success (Quality and Quantity)
          <ol>
          <li>a. Academic. To achieve an overall academic success rate of 95 per cent. across all training in the customer-approved Annual Agreed Training Requirement, based upon those students that successfully complete the required pre-course assessment where appropriate.</li>
          <li>b. Military. Ensure that 80 per cent. of all DMETA personnel, whose medical category permits, achieve their Service's annual mandatory individual military training.</li>

It also recommended that the DDA should develop more challenging targets including a new system of Dental Risk (DR) categorisation. This has now been achieved and the Key Targets for the DDA for 2003&#x2013;04 are as follows:</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05099">DEFENCE DENTAL AGENCY&#x2014;KEY TARGETS FOR FINANCIAL YEAR 2003&#x2013;2004</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05100">Key Target 1&#x2014;The Operational Requirement</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05101">To meet 100 per cent. of the Commander in Chief's requirements for DDA personnel for operational deployments, major exercises and collective training.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05102">Key Target 2&#x2014;Dental Risk</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05103">To achieve 90 per cent. of all Service personnel in Dental Risk categories A and B by 31 March 2004.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05104">Key Targets 3&#x2014;Treatment Needs</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05105">To reduce the Treatment Need Index for each Service to the following: RN at or below 400; Army at or below 600; RAF at or below 330 by 31 March 2004.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05106">Key Target 4&#x2014;Military Training</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05107">To ensure that 80 per cent. of all DDA personnel, whose medical category permits, achieve their Service's annual individual, mandatory, military training.</p>
