          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0402P0-05060">RPG 13 sets out the spatial development strategy that encompasses proposals for the development of the Region's economy, housing and transport infrastructure, and other land uses. Within the terms of the strategy, priority is to be given to sustainable development and investment within the North West Metropolitan Area (especially the Regional Poles of Manchester/Salford and Liverpool), together with defined Regeneration Priority Areas. RPG13 also sets out proposals for the conservation, management and enhancement of the Region's natural and cultural environment.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05061">I am pleased that much of the vision, objectives and core strategy of RPG 13 carries forward to a great extent what was proposed in the original draft RPG prepared by the North West Regional Assembly (NWRA). RPG 13 reflects the effective working that was achieved between the NWRA, local authorities and other stakeholders, all of which have made valuable contributions to refine and enhance the original draft guidance through public consultation. It builds on the inclusive process for preparing RPG that the Government have put in place. Many of the comments received in response to the consultations carried out earlier have made a positive contribution to the overall strategy for sustainable development and have been taken on board.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05062">The North West Regional Assembly, in its role as the Regional Planning Body, will work with partners&#x2014;including the business community&#x2014;to ensure its effective implementation, monitoring and review.</p>
