          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0402P0-05008">I am today announcing my decision on recommendations contained in the O'Hare report on the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development's arrangements for the provision of agri-food education and R&D in Northern Ireland. I first announced my proposals on 25 November 2002, at which time I issued the proposals for public consultation. Having taken account of this consultation, I am now confirming the final decisions. These are detailed in the appendix below.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05009">FURTHER INFORMATION</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05010">The Government's response to the O'Hare report was issued for public consultation until 28 February 2003, after their announcement on 25 November 2002.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05011">The O'Hare review was conducted by an independent panel, consisting of three ministerial appointees. The team's report was completed in April 2002.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05012">APPENDIX</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05013">Details of the Government's final decisions on the way forward in response to the O'Hare report are listed below.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05014">CENTRAL DECISION TAKING PROCESS</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05015">An advisory board on R&D and technology transfer will be set up, consisting of independent expert advisors from science and industry and with some additional membership nominated by the Rural Stakeholders Forum. Appointments to the board will be made through a transparent process using pre-set criteria. Strategic advice on the formulation of the R&D and technology transfer programme will be provided to the Department.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05016">TRANSFER OF THE SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SCIENCE TO EITHER THE QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY OF BELFAST (QUB) OR THE UNIVERSITY OF ULSTER (UU)</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05017">The educational provision currently delivered at the School of Agriculture and Food Science at QUB will be transferred to one of the two NI universities. The process of selection of the university will be conducted by a panel consisting of internal and external members which will oversee the competitive exercise. The funding will be ring-fenced for an initial period of three years. Suitable transitional arrangements will be put in place for both funding and students.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_36ws' title='Col. 36WS &mdash; HC Deb 31 March 2003 vol 402 c36WS' name='column_36ws' href='#column_36ws' rel='bookmark'>36WS</a><p id="S6CV0402P0-05018">Full legal protection will apply to terms and conditions of any staff who transfer to the chosen university. Full consultation with unions, staff and the receiving university will be an integral part of the process.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05019">RATIONALISATION OF THE THREE DARD COLLEGES INTO A SINGLE COLLEGE ON THREE SITES</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05020">The three DARD Colleges will be combined to form a single college within DARD leading to greater efficiency in service delivery. The single DARD college, under a single Principal, will have a separate business plan, targets and budget and will produce separate accounts.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05021">It will continue its advisory, teaching and lifelong learning provision.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05022">A Management Committee will be appointed with external representation. Representatives will be chosen according to pre-set criteria.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05023">In addition, the single college will have overall responsibility for the delivery of knowledge and technology transfer and adoption and will liaise closely with the new NDPB, the retained Science Service, universities, research institutes and other providers to ensure cohesive and comprehensive delivery.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05024">The arrangement will be reviewed after 3 years.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05025">ESTABLISHMENT OF A NON-DEPARTMENTAL PUBLIC BODY (NDPB)</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05026">A new NDPB will be set up to deliver R&D and analytical and diagnostic services currently provided by DARD Science Service. However, core provision will be retained within DARD to provide an emergency response capability. This arrangement will be reviewed after 3 years.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05027">A board will be appointed to manage the new NDPB. Appointments will be made using a transparent process and according to pre-set criteria. The NDPB will continue to provide R&D services for other Government Departments under suitable contractual arrangements.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05028">Full legal protection will apply to terms and conditions of any staff who transfer to the new NDPB.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05029">INCLUSION OF THE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF NORTHERN IRELAND (ARINI) WITHIN THE NEW NDPB</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05030">ARINI will be abolished and its functions and staff transferred to the new NDPB. Negotiations will be undertaken with the existing ARINI Board and the relevant trade unions on the arrangements for transfer.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05031">Full legal protection will apply to terms and conditions of any staff who transfer from ARINI to the new NDPB.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05032">OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER FACILITY WITHIN THE SINGLE DARD COLLEGE</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05033">Overall responsibility for knowledge and technology transfer and adoption will be the responsibility of the single DARD College which will liaise closely with the new NDPB, the retained emergency core, universities, research institutes and other providers to ensure

          cohesive and comprehensive delivery, irrespective of the delivery location. I recognise the concerns expressed in the consultation exercise that the continuation of comprehensive technology transfer provision is essential to the future development of the agri-food industry.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05034">This arrangement will be reviewed in three years.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05035">INTRODUCTION OF A COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS FOR DARD FUNDED R&D</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05036">Competitive tendering will be developed for DARD funded R&D. However, an R&D programme of sufficient size and quality will be core-funded at the NDPB to ensure that the required skills base is maintained. Core funding will also be provided for the analytical, diagnostic and surveillance functions carried out by the NDPB.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05037">LINKS</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05038">Clear links will be developed between DARD, the DARD college, the new NDPB, the universities and other research providers to ensure that R&D, technology transfer and education are delivered as effectively as possible.</p>
