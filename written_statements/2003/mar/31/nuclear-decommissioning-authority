          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0402P0-05048">Following detailed analysis of a number of potential locations, I am able to announce that the Government have decided on West Cumbria as its preferred location for the head office of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05049">The Government believe that&#x2014;while a number of other locations could offer similar benefits in terms of the operational needs of the NDA&#x2014;the NDA will bring significant benefits to the community of West Cumbria by providing a catalyst for economic growth and diversification. These benefits are particularly important to a community that has suffered significantly from economic setbacks and recent job losses. West Cumbria is already a high priority area for economic regeneration and has a long history of engagement in the nuclear business.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05050">The decision is the outcome of a two-stage assessment process. The first stage conducted by the Department of Trade and Industry compared eight locations throughout the UK and concluded that the North West was the region of choice.</p><p id="S6CV0402P0-05051">The second stage, conducted by the North West Development Agency, compared two areas within the region&#x2014;West Cumbria and the area west of Manchester. The results showed that while there were some differences in the two locations, both locations would deliver against the operational needs of the NDA. Hence, their respective needs for investment and economic regeneration became the deciding factor and on this basis I have chosen West Cumbria.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_39ws' title='Col. 39WS &mdash; HC Deb 31 March 2003 vol 402 c39WS' name='column_39ws' href='#column_39ws' rel='bookmark'>39WS</a><p id="S6CV0402P0-05052">Today's decision clearly demonstrates the Government's commitment (made in the White Paper on Managing the Nuclear Legacy) to support the communities in which the NDA will operate and in particular, to generate new growth and opportunities in areas such as West Cumbria.</p>
