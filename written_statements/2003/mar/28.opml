      <outline id='3529627' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Mr. Elliot Morley)&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04913"&gt;The problems caused by invasive non-native species can be serious by transforming our ecosystems, altering natural habitats and threatening native species. This issue has been identified by the Convention on Biological Diversity as presenting one of the primary threats to biodiversity globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04914"&gt;Recognising this threat, in 2001 my Department, with the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales, convened a working group comprising a wide range of stakeholders to undertake a fundamental review of policy and practice on non-native species. The review was a commitment in the Government&apos;s Rural White Paper. This working group has now completed its review and submitted its report, published today by my Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04915"&gt;I welcome the report and recommendations of the working group on tackling this important matter. This is a complex and wide-ranging issue and we will be considering the review&apos;s report carefully in developing the Government&apos;s strategy to take this forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;24WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04916"&gt;The Review was undertaken on a Great Britain-wide basis with significant input from the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales. Wildlife policy is devolved and so I cannot make commitments on behalf of Scotland and Wales. However, my Department will be liaising closely with the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales to investigate the scope for development of a co-ordinated response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04917"&gt;Our Department will aim to produce an initial response to the report by this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04918"&gt;Copies of the Report are available in the Libraries of both Houses.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Non-native Species' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/mar/28/non-native-species'></outline>

      <outline id='3529633' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. David Lammy)&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04921"&gt;I am publishing today "NHS complaints reform&amp;#x2014;making things right". It describes reforms to the National Health Service complaints procedure and sets out a programme to improve management of the whole complaints system, elements of which will be subject to the passage of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04922"&gt;The programme builds on the existing NHS complaint procedure, as well as wider initiatives, to introduce operational improvements focused on:&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;making the system more flexible so that there are a range of ways in which people can express concerns about the services they have received,&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;improving the local resolution stage so that formal complaints are more likely to be resolved, reducing the need for them to escalate unnecessarily,&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;radical reform to the independent review stage, subject to primary legislation&amp;#x2014;by placing responsibility for it with the new Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (CHAI),and&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;making sure information about complaints and their causes are an integral part of the system that assures safe, high quality care, which is constantly improving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04923"&gt;We will achieve this through a combination of changes to the structure and operation of the complaints procedure itself, and by recognising the place&#x000A;&lt;image src="S6CV0402P0I0828"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;25WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;complaints management has in the system for improving services and the quality of patients&apos; experience of health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04924"&gt;The need for primary legislation to establish CHAI means it will not be fully operational before April 2004. This dictates the timetable for comprehensive reform of the NHS complaints procedure as whole. In the mean time, we will pursue supporting initiatives to bring about improvements in the general approach to complaints in the NHS, and pave the way for the more substantive reforms in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04925"&gt;Copies of "NHS complaints reform&amp;#x2014;making things right" have been placed in the Library.&lt;/p&gt;' title='NHS Complaints' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/mar/28/nhs-complaints'></outline>

      <outline id='3529637' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. David Jamieson)&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04926"&gt;The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) has now completed a criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding an incident on 16 January 2003 involving an abortive landing of the passenger ferry ALI CAT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04927"&gt;The ALI CAT is a Class V vessel operating a passenger service only between Dunoon and Gourock during the period 16 October 2002 to 3 April 2003. I understand that arrangements are in place to provide appropriate services for the next 12 month period commencing 4 April 2003. On arrival in the Clyde on 16 October 2002 she was surveyed by an MCA surveyor, found to be in excellent condition and issued with a Class V Passenger Ship Certificate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04928"&gt;Following allegations in November 2002 of the ship operation being unsafe the vessel was inspected twice. The second inspection involved the Health and Safety Executive and resulted in minor recommendations to improve gangway stability. The ship operation on both occasions was found to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04929"&gt;An incident on 16 January 2003 involving an abortive landing of the passenger ferry ALI CAT due to adverse weather conditions, caused passengers to raise concerns. The MCA has instigated a thorough criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding that incident and the general accusation of unsafe operating practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04930"&gt;The MCA interviewed a total of 14 persons including three passengers that were on board the ALI CAT. The Agency was asked to publicise the inquiry to give more witnesses the opportunity to give evidence. However, criminal investigations are not made available to the public other than through the mechanism of a court trial and therefore this was not appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04931"&gt;A wave height measurement gauge was fitted at Dunoon Pier in January 2003. The ship operator modified on-board procedures instructing the Master of the ALI CAT not to embark or disembark passengers at the pier when the wave height is in excess of 0.6 metres (the lower limit of the maximum range recommended).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;26WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04932"&gt;There were occasions when the ALI CAT did berth at Dunoon Pier contrary to the Pier Masters advice before the wave gauge was installed. However, the legal position in this situation is that it is the Master/Skipper who decides whether it is safe to dock the vessel, and this may differ from the advice of the pier authority. No statement taken during the MCA&apos;s investigation indicated that the ALI CAT was advised not to berth on the 16 January 2003. The Assistant Pier Master, the Master and the Mate of the ALI CAT were all interviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04933"&gt;Since the wave height gauge was installed in January 2003 there have been no occasions when the skipper has ignored the advice from the pier master and berthed the ALI CAT at Dunoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04934"&gt;The MCA&apos;s report has determined that there was no serious breach of the Merchant Shipping Regulations caused by the incident on the 16 January 2003. It would be inappropriate to publicise the evidence taken and the deliberations which led MCA to arrive at this conclusion. However, the report recommended that:&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;The owner of ALI CAT should develop Risk Analysis Plans for each of the routes operated by his vessels, with particular regard to systems of mooring in different weather conditions, which can be expected throughout the year.&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Caledonian MacBrayne, Argyll and Bute Council and the owner of the ALI CAT should undertake a joint review of the mooring system.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04935"&gt;The MCA have contacted the Chief Inspector of the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) and advised him of the latest developments in relation to the ALI CAT incident. The Chief Inspector has reviewed the details in relation to the ALI CAT incident and has reconfirmed that the incident does not warrant investigation by the MAIB.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Catamaran Incident' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/mar/28/catamaran-incident'></outline>

      <outline id='3529640' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Hilary Benn)&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04936"&gt;The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 introduced statutory time limits under which cases must be brought to court and dealt with within certain prescribed time limits. These have been piloted in youth courts in six areas in England and Wales and evaluated by independent researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04937"&gt;Sections 43&amp;#x2013;45 of the 1998 Act amended section 22 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to provide for the introduction of three sorts of statutory time limit (in addition to the statutory custody time limits which are already in force). The limits are:&#x000A;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;an initial time limit of 36 days from arrest to first listing.&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;an overall time limit of 99 days from first listing to start of trial.&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;a sentencing time limit of 29 days from conviction to sentence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04938"&gt;The limits apply to all offences and start at the point of arrest. Whether the decision in a youth case is to reprimand, finally warn or charge, this has to be achieved within the 36 day period; after that time, the&#x000A;&lt;image src="S6CV0402P0I0829"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;27WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;case cannot be prosecuted without an extension from the court. Once in court, the case must reach the point of trial within 99 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04939"&gt;The police or the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) can seek extensions of the initial or overall time limit but must satisfy the court that they have good and sufficient cause and that they have acted with due diligence. If these time limits are exceeded without an extension being granted then the case must be discontinued and cannot be re-instituted unless fresh evidence comes to light. There is an appeal mechanism in relation to refusals of applications for the overall time limit but not the initial time limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04940"&gt;The evaluators recommended that statutory time limits should be implemented from a human rights perspective. They argued that delays in the youth court need to be curbed in terms of time limits rather than time targets, because limits apply to each individual case rather than an average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04941"&gt;The report recommends that before implementation, there should be a right of appeal by the police against a refusal to extend the initial time limit pre-charge. This is in order to avoid victims and witnesses of crime falling foul of the system if the police fail to prepare a case on time. Primary legislation would be needed to implement this change. In addition, the report suggests removing the sentencing time limit altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04942"&gt;The report also expresses the view that national rollout would require significant funding, training and a review of court room and staff availability. We have carefully considered the final evaluation report and have consulted the agencies involved at national level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04943"&gt;We have also given careful consideration to the priorities for the Criminal Justice System (CJS) following the Spending Review and the new national targets for the CJS. We have reviewed measures and targets which impact on performance across the board, to ensure a cohesive approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04944"&gt;Although statutory time limits have been made to work in the pilot areas, concerns have been expressed by the criminal justice agencies at the burden which the limits impose on the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04945"&gt;The Association of Chief Police Officers and the Crown Prosecution Service consider that the limits have increased the administrative burden for the police and CPS in dealing with youth cases. They are also concerned that the limits might conflict with the priority being given to improving the quality and effectiveness of case preparation to reduce the number of ineffective trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04946"&gt;The overall view is that the process adds to bureaucracy&amp;#x2014;if extensions are needed, applications have to be made to the court and notice served on the defence; and the time limit has to be recalculated for periods unlawfully at large. While only a few cases were lost because extensions were not applied for or were refused, this would be much more of a problem nationally and the potential for loss of public confidence in the system would be that much greater. The impact on victims is of particular concern, especially if the case was perceived as being dropped because of a procedural technicality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;28WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04947"&gt;We also consider that it is not necessary to have rigid statutory time limits in each and every case in order to deliver our aim of speedy and efficient preparation for trials or sentencing. In our view, custody time limits and the power of the courts to stay cases where delay amounts to an abuse of process are adequate legal safeguards against undue delay in bringing cases to trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04948"&gt;On balance, we consider that the benefits outlined by the final report are outweighed by the arguments put forward by the various agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04949"&gt;Taken together with the many other measures that are being taken to improve case management in the Criminal Justice System, we have decided not to extend statutory time limits across England and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04950"&gt;Accordingly, I have made Regulations to revoke statutory time limits in the pilot areas; these will be laid before the House shortly, to come into force on 22 April 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04951"&gt;The focus on timeliness will continue. All CJS areas will be expected to work towards meeting and maintaining the Government&apos;s objective to halve the average time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders&amp;#x2014;a target that has been achieved nationally for 15 consecutive months. Timeliness targets have been extended to encompass all youth court cases and other cases in the adult magistrates courts and Crown Courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04952"&gt;The key to successful case management is interagency co-operation with the police, prosecution and courts all playing their part as cases move through the system. We have given the youth courts the tools to monitor live cases and have provided funding for case progression officers. The Local Criminal Justice Board will monitor performance on timeliness and will report to the National Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0402P0-04953"&gt;The evaluation report is available to Members on the Home Office research website: &lt;u&gt;http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds.&lt;/u&gt; Copies have been placed in the Library.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Youth Court' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/mar/28/youth-court'></outline>
