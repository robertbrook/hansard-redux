          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0401P0-04900">Later today, I intend to launch a public consultation process on proposals for reform of water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland.</p><p id="S6CV0401P0-04901">Since assuming responsibility for the Regional Development Ministerial portfolio, I have been acutely aware of the need for massive investment in Northern Ireland's water and sewerage infrastructure. Such a step-change in long-term investment can only be achieved through the development of secure, self-financing arrangements which also address the needs of the public as fairly and efficiently as possible.</p><p id="S6CV0401P0-04902">In principle, this will require the introduction of domestic water charges in tandem with structural reform of the delivery of water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland to ensure that people will not be asked

          to pay more than is absolutely necessary. I am committed to full and inclusive consultation through which I believe arrangements for the delivery of water and sewerage services, tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of the people of Northern Ireland, can be developed.</p><p id="S6CV0401P0-04903">The Consultation. Paper which I have published today sets out a range of possible options for domestic water charging. Possible structural arrangements for water and sewerage delivery and business models for a reformed Water Service are also outlined, along with the associated issues of economic and consumer regulation and mechanisms for consumer representation on water issues.</p><p id="S6CV0401P0-04904">The period of public consultation on these issues will run until June 2003. Following a period of assessment of the responses to the consultation document, detailed proposals will be brought forward for further public consultation in the autumn, ultimately leading into the production of appropriate legislation.</p><p id="S6CV0401P0-04905">Copies of the Consultation Document; "The Reform of Water and Sewerage Services in Northern Ireland" have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
