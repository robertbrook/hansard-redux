          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0401P0-04874">In the light of concern that some asylum applicants from other countries are posing falsely as nationals from Iraq, we have decided to pilot language analysis testing for use in cases where appropriate when a person claiming Iraqi nationality applies for asylum. Language testing arrangements in such cases will start on 12 March 2003 and continue for an initial period of one month.</p><p id="S6CV0401P0-04875">The purpose of language analysis is to provide expert evidence which helps to identify the place of origin of asylum seekers. Language analysis is used in a number of European countries, and the results have been generally successful. In the UK language analysis has been used already in the case of asylum claims made by nationals claiming to be from Afghanistan, Somalia or Sri Lanka. It was found to be a valuable aid in the asylum consideration process, clearly identifying in many instances that the applicant was not of the nationality he or she claimed to be, or not from the area of the country from which they claimed to originate. Language analysis also benefited genuine applicants by confirming the information they gave about their nationality.</p><p id="S6CV0401P0-04876">The extension of language testing to nationals from Iraq is being given legal effect today by an authorisation made by myself under section 19D of the <a href="/acts/race-relations-act-1976">Race Relations Act 1976</a>. Where there are objective reasons for doubting the nationality of a person claiming to be from Iraq, the authorisation will enable staff in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate to request the applicant to undertake a further interview which will be taped and sent to a language expert for analysis. Individuals may refuse to consent to this further interview (which will be conducted at the initial screening stage), but this refusal can be taken into account when determining whether the applicant has established the facts of their case. This may lead to their claim being refused.</p><p id="S6CV0401P0-04877">We will review the need for this further authorisation later in the year. Independent scrutiny of the likely effect of authorisations made by Ministers and how they are operated in practice by officials is exercised by the race monitor, Mary Coussey, who reports to Parliament via the Secretary of State.</p><p id="S6CV0401P0-04878">A copy of the addition authorisation has been place in the Library of the House. Any additional or amended authorisations will also be placed in the Library.</p>
