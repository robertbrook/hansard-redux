          <p class="first-para">I have today announced grants totalling &#x00A3;2.285m to 155 bidders to the second round of the Department's Cycling Projects Fund. The fund was launched in 2002 as a two-year funding programme to support the growth of local provision for cycling.</p><p>The response from schools, NHS providers, cycling groups and both the voluntary and private sector has been excellent. I have therefore decided, as in Round One, to double the amount of grant originally available as part on the Government's ongoing commitment to encouraging cycling.</p><p>The fund was open to organisations, other than local traffic authorities, promoting any project that could be expected to achieve an increase in cycling. Typical examples included cycle parking, cycle routes, cycle training and workplace facilities for cyclists.</p><p>The winning schemes come from all over the country and my Department's funding will allow projects to the value of over &#x00A3;5m to progress. The schemes cover a wide variety of projects including cycle parking, safe routes to school, local and National Cycle Network routes, cycle training and promotional projects aimed at raising the profile of cycling. I am confident these projects will be as successful as those we funded in Round One and will help us achieve a significant increase in cycling at the local level.</p><p>My Department is encouraging local highway authorities to make funds available for similar projects.</p><p>I have placed in the Libraries of the House a copy of the Department's Press Notice published today providing a full list of the winning projects.</p>
