      <outline id='3498520' text="The Minister for Local Government, Regional Governance and Fire (Mr. Nick Raynsford)&lt;p&gt;I am publishing today figures showing that English councils have collected an extra &amp;#x00A3;40 million in council taxes this year. The tables are available in both Libraries of the House. They can also be found at the website of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister,&lt;u&gt;http://www.odpm.gov.uk/.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figures demonstrate the continuing success of a joint initiative launched in 2001 by the Government and the Local Government Association (LGA) to help poorly performing councils improve their collection rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The council taxes and non-domestic rates collection results 2002&amp;#x2013;03 show that English councils had collected &amp;#x00A3;14.09 billion in council taxes by the end of March 2003. The figures represent 96.4 per cent. of the &amp;#x00A3;14.62 billion collectable. This is an increase of 0.3 percentage points on top of the previous year's increase of 0.3 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am very pleased local authorities are continuing to improve their collection of council tax. By working in partnership with the LGA we have been able to support councils in their efforts. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will continue this partnership in particular with the development of a Good Practices Guide for local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important councils keep up their good work. The money collected for council tax is spent on essential public services and unpaid taxes create a burden for those residents who do pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The councils showing the best improvements in their performance included some of those that had previously had the lowest collection rates, such as Hackney, which improved its collection rate from 74 per cent. during 2001&amp;#x2013;02 to 79.5 per cent. this year&amp;#x2014;an increase of 5.5 percentage points; Torridge, which improved its collection rate from 92.1 per cent. during 2001&amp;#x2013;02 to 97.1 per cent. this year&amp;#x2014;an increase of 5.0 percentage points; and Lambeth, which improved its collection rate from 86.5 per cent during 2001&amp;#x2013;02 to 90.1 per cent. this year&amp;#x2013;an increase of 3.6 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other improving councils included Newham (increase of 3.2 percentage points), Leicester (increase of 3 percentage points), Derby and Eastbourne (increase of 2.5 percentage points) and Haringey and Waltham Forest (increase of 2.4 percentage points).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, collection rates for non-domestic rates (business rates) were released today. Figures show that &amp;#x00A3;14.89 billion in non-domestic rates for 2002&amp;#x2013;03 had&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;44WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;been collected by the end of March. This represents 98.2 per cent. of the &amp;#x00A3;15.17 billion collectable, an improvement of 0.3 percentage points on last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has collected information on the level of arrears outstanding. Total gross arrears in England for council tax as at 31 March 2003 are estimated to have been &amp;#x00A3;1.5 billion. Estimated total gross arrears figures for England at the end of March 2003 for non-domestic rates and community charge are also available. These total &amp;#x00A3;0.7 billion and &amp;#x00A3;0.1 billion respectively.&lt;/p&gt;" title='Local Government Finance' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/jun/26/local-government-finance'></outline>

      <outline id='3498539' text='The Minister for School Standards (Mr. David Miliband)&lt;p&gt;On 26 February, I made a statement about the Government&apos;s proposals for a new approach to capital investment, "Building Schools for the Future". The proposals are to:&lt;quote&gt;Continue existing, successful capital programmes for primary and secondary schools; but use the extra capital investment available in 2005&amp;#x2013;06 for a major programme of secondary school building;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Collaborate better with other capital funders to create schools that are community assets;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Target the extra capital investment on geographical areas, covering groups of schools;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Develop exemplar designs to ensure consistently high standards of design for all new schools; and&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Establish a new national body to support local authorities in ensuring that new schools are well designed, built on time, offer value for money to the taxpayer, and properly maintained over their lives.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We consulted widely on these proposals and received 1,141 responses by the close of consultation on 31 May. We also held six consultation meetings across England to listen to the views of schools, local education authorities, dioceses, local learning and skills councils, and others with an interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four-fifths of respondents agree the time is right to approach capital investment in a new way to build schools of the future. This level of support, which extends across schools, local authorities, and the design and construction industries, means we can push ahead with reform. We need to rebuild and refurbish our secondary schools on a much larger scale, not just patch and mend worn-out buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will also look carefully at the availability and balance of capital funding across the system, so that there is significant investment to address the urgent building needs of primary schools and secondary schools that are not included in the early phases of "Building Schools for the Future".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local authorities and local people will play a central role in drawing together this new approach. "Building Schools for the Future" is about Government supporting the delivery of local educational visions, and the proposed new national body will be designed to offer technical support to assist local partnerships deliver their strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new approach will also help central and local government plan together over the long-term and improve on the old culture of annual, win-lose bidding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;48WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must ensure we have a standard of school that our young people deserve, inspirational well-designed schools to motivate teaching and learning, and up-to-date facilities to enable us to compete as a world-class economy in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Department is writing today to all local education authorities, and to those who either responded to the consultation or attended one of the regional consultation meetings. We are announcing the consultation results, and confirming our intention to proceed with our plans. We hope to issue to local education authorities in July detailed guidance on how to access funding under "Building Schools for the Future".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty copies of this letter, the summary of consultation responses, and a report on the regional events will be placed in the Library.&lt;/p&gt;' title='"Building Schools for the Future"' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/jun/26/building-schools-for-the-future'></outline>
