          <p class="first-para">I am pleased to report that the first of the Queen's Golden Jubilee Awards for voluntary service by groups in the community were announced on Monday 2 June.</p><p>This prestigious new annual Award for groups of volunteers has been given this year to 200 groups whose outstanding voluntary activity has enhanced and improved the quality of life and opportunity for others in the community. The Government actively support the work of the voluntary and community sector and are encouraging more people to participate in community activity. This Award will give some of those people the recognition they richly deserve. The details of the winning groups are as follows:
