          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0397P0-04170">Today sees the launch of the first ever science and technology strategy for the police.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_29ws' title='Col. 29WS &mdash; HC Deb 16 January 2003 vol 397 c29WS' name='column_29ws' href='#column_29ws' rel='bookmark'>29WS</a><p id="S6CV0397P0-04171">Science and technology have been important tools in the fight against crime for many years. However, as criminals become more technologically aware, so it becomes vital that the police service is not only properly equipped to combat this new strain of criminals but also that the tools they use are as effective and efficient as possible. From early on in the police reform process the major stakeholders in policing identified the need for an overarching strategy for the police use of science and technology&#x2014;a commitment which was made in the police reform white paper: "Policing a New Century: A Blue Print for Reform".<sup>1</sup></p><p id="S6CV0397P0-04172">I established the Police Science and Technology Strategy Group to bring together the key stakeholders and commissioned them to identify and prioritise the police's requirements for science and technology. This work has formed the basis of the overarching strategy that we are launching today.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-04173">The purpose of the S&T strategy is to ensure the police service is equipped to exploit the opportunities in science and technology to deliver effective policing as part of a modern and respected criminal justice system. To achieve this the strategy identifies three key aims:
          <q>to establish priorities for current and future science and technology applications and research;</q>
          <q>to co-ordinate the development and implementation of technology between users and suppliers to ensure a coherent and effective process; and</q>
          <q>to implement processes for future scanning to ensure that the police service can exploit new technology at the earliest opportunity and is prepared for new technology-based threats. </q></p><p id="S6CV0397P0-04174">These activities will support the delivery of national priorities for policing as identified in the National Policing Plan. This strategy will inform local planning as forces, police authorities, and key providers draw up their individual plans for the use of science and technology. Hence, the role of this strategy is not to usurp or replace individual plans and strategies but to provide a framework for their successful development. This provides the opportunity for a more co-ordinated approach in those areas where that is appropriate.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-04175">An important first step in this new process was the identification of the capabilities which science and technology can enhance to deliver more effective policing. The most important of these have already been outlined in the National Policing Plan: the effective use of intelligence gathering technology, secure exchange of data and mobile data input and retrieval, effective management of investigation and case handling, and maximising the value of evidence including the use of DNA.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-04176">The process of prioritising, improving co-ordination and scanning for future threats and opportunities is not a static one, but will be developed and improved upon over the coming year. This strategy sets out how this process will be carried out.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-04177">Despite being very different in their roles and status, the Forensic Science Service, Police Information Technology Organisation and Police Scientific Development Branch will all play important roles in delivering the strategy. The strategy, along with the priorities it has identified, will provide the framework

          for their individual plans for 2003&#x2013;04 and beyond to ensure a more co-ordinated approach to meeting the science and technology needs of the police service.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-04178">This first overarching strategy, developed with both the key stakeholders and independent experts, marks a significant step but is not the culmination of our work. The next and perhaps most important step is that of implementation. This, with our partners in the Police Science and Technology Strategy Group, will be our main focus for the year ahead.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-04179"><q><sup>1</sup>Home Office (2001), <span class="italic">Policing New Century: A Blueprint for Reform,</span> CM5326, Stationery Office</q></p>
