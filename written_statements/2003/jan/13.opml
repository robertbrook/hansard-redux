These goods include HMX pellets which could be suitable for use in anti-personnel landmines. However, the Government are satisfied that these HMX pellets, specifically designed for cutting collars and perforating tubes, are intended only for the legitimate end-use stated. The risk of these goods being diverted for use by the Iranian military is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Export Licences (Iran)' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/jan/13/export-licences-iran'></outline>
