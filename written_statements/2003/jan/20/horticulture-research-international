          <p class="first-para">We are grateful to the Quinquennial Review team for their detailed and incisive report published on 23 September on which we have now consulted widely. The review team have considered the responses to the public consultation exercise which concluded on 18 November and produced an addendum to their report, which I am placing in the Library of the House.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_4ws' title='Col. 4WS &mdash; HC Deb 20 January 2003 vol 398 c4WS' name='column_4ws' href='#column_4ws' rel='bookmark'>4WS</a><p>We understand the importance of reaching early conclusions from the viewpoint of HRI's staff, their customers and other stakeholders. This interim announcement, pending further detailed study and negotiations, sets out our intentions.</p><p>The Government broadly accept the general tenor of the review team's analysis and recommendations. There is a clear need for skilled and strategic horticultural science to underpin our policies and industry needs. HRI is a substantial asset of horticultural science excellence. In its present form, however, HRI is not viable and needs to be rationalised.</p><p>DEFRA will now enter into detailed discussions with HRI and other parties, in particular the University of Warwick and the East Malling Trust for Horticultural Research, to establish whether the scenarios recommended by the review team are achievable and affordable, and whether any further Government investment is necessary.</p><p>We hope to reach detailed decisions in principle about the future of HRI by the end of March 2003. Matters for consideration will include the remit and research capacity of the successor arrangements; ownership of land and buildings; staffing and pension matters; and income sources. Subject to satisfactory negotiations, the plan would be to put in place the new arrangements for HRI's future by 1 April 2004.</p><p>In the meantime, HRI will continue as currently constituted. A programme of research is in place from DEFRA, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and other funders. We shall take steps to ensure that any transfer to successor organisations occurs as quickly and as seamlessly as possible in a way that enables HRI to meet all of its commitments.</p>
