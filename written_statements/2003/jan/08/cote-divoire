          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0397P0-06278">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, remains deeply concerned about the crisis in Cote d'Ivoire, and its implications both for the people of Cote d'Ivoire and for the wider region.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-06279">Recent fighting, particularly in the west of the country between the MPIGO/MJP rebel groups and Government forces, means that the security situation in Cote d'Ivoire remains extremely fragile. Since 9 December 2002, we have advised all UK nationals present in Cote d'Ivoire to use commercial means to leave the country.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-06280">We have consistently made clear that the UK opposes any attempt to overthrow the elected government by force. We continue to provide support to the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) leaders to promote a political settlement which addresses the causes of the crisis, and to restore peace and security. UK support includes up to

          &#x00A3;2 million to assist the deployment of the Ghanaian contingent of the ECOWAS peace-monitoring force. We are working closely with France, and other partners, to ensure effective international support for these regional efforts. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development has also agreed to provide up to &#x00A3;1 million in humanitarian assistance for Cote d'Ivoire.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-06281">We remain gravely concerned at reports of mass killings and serious violations of human rights in Cote d'Ivoire. We welcome the UN Secretary-General's decision to request the High Commissioner for Human Rights to seek further information about these violations.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-06282">We have also been concerned at all breaches of the 17 October 2002 ceasefire agreement. We are pleased that President Gbagbo has agreed to submit a crisis resolution plan to all Ivorian players and to ECOWAS leaders, and to consult them on it. We also welcome the fresh commitments made by him and by the leaders of the MPCI rebel group, during the 3&#x2013;4 January visit of the French Foreign Minister, to respect the ceasefire. France has now offered to host a conference from 15 January involving all Ivorian political forces. We urge all parties to engage seriously in the search for an inclusive political solution to the crisis.</p>
