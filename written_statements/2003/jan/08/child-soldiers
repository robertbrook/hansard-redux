          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0397P0-06198">The latest UN Secretary General's report on children and armed conflict covers a range of issues, including child soldiers, on which we are actively engaged. My Department finds the report a useful source of information and guidance. The emphasis on the "era of application" is particularly to be welcomed and supported.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-06199">While the report provides some cause for optimism, for instance the coming into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, there is much more to be done to reduce the impact of armed conflict on children, their families and communities. The best way to achieve this is by the prevention, reduction and resolution of armed conflicts. My Department has intensified its work with other Government Departments to this end. While the Secretary General's report, pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1379, identifies various countries where the direct use of children in conflict continues, it is to be welcomed that the report also focuses on those aspects of children and armed conflict that tend to receive less attention, such as the impact of land-mines and the sexual exploitation of girls.</p>

          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0397P0-06201">No direct discussions have been held with the above-mentioned Governments and Administrations specifically on the recent report. In Afghanistan the UK will be sending an expert to support the UN and the transitional authority with the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former and current combatants. The new Afghan National Army will have no child soldiers in its ranks.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_253ws' title='Col. 253WS &mdash; HC Deb 08 January 2003 vol 397 c253WS' name='column_253ws' href='#column_253ws' rel='bookmark'>253WS</a><p id="S6CV0397P0-06202">The UK is both very actively engaged in the peace processes in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi and a major contributor to the process of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration in the Great Lakes region. We are also playing a part in the Somalia peace process. Information from a number of sources, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the United Nations, indicates that use of child soldiers is a serious problem in Burma, both by the Burmese army and various Burmese insurgent groups. In November, the EU co-sponsored a resolution on Burma at the United Nations General Assembly that expressed grave concern over the human rights situation in Burma, including the use of child soldiers.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-06203">In addition UNICEF has recently produced, with our assistance, a publication on the use of child soldiers in the East Asia and Pacific region. The Quaker United Nations Office has recently produced a groundbreaking report&#x2014;with my Department's support&#x2014;on the lives of girl child soldiers in Colombia, Angola, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. For instance, the report describes particularly the relationship between sexual or physical abuse and exploitation at home and girls' willingness to become involved in armed conflict and how living in poverty played a key role in girls joining a movement or being abducted.</p>
