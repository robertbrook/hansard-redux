          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0397P0-06502">Responsibility for putting in place appropriate local arrangements for vaccinations against smallpox will rest with the regional directors of public health (RDsPH). The Department of Health has recently published its draft guidance for dealing with smallpox and invited comment and discussion on the plans for dealing with any smallpox outbreak. RDsPH were involved in the drafting of the guidance. In this guidance, it is intended to establish 12 regional smallpox response groups across the United Kingdom, consisting of infectious disease physicians, paediatricians, public health physicians, microbiologists/virologists, acute care and communicable disease control nurses and occupational health staff who will be able to set up specialist care and vaccination centres for the regions in the event of a smallpox emergency.</p>

Mass vaccination of the population could be justifiable if there was a smallpox attack or outbreak but it would not be acceptable to expose people to the risk of vaccination in the absence of any possible exposure to the smallpox virus.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-06508">Smallpox vaccine has a much higher rate of serious complications than vaccines that are in regular use today. Certain groups are at even higher risk, such as those with weak immune systems or with severe eczema.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-06509">We have already announced that a small number of key frontline national health service staff and a small number of military personnel who would provide the first response in the event of a confirmed, suspected or threatened release of smallpox will be vaccinated shortly. We are discussing with other Government Departments how to identify key workers in the emergency services and agreeing circumstances and timing under which they might be vaccinated.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-06510">Our contingency plans for dealing with smallpox are detailed in the draft guidelines on smallpox available on <a class='resolved-url' href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/epcu/cbr/biol/smallpoxplan.htm">http://www.doh.gov.uk/epcu/cbr/biol/smallpoxplan.htm</a></p>
