In addition, four major publicly funded schemes involving acute settings have also been given the go ahead of which three are now open. These, along with a number of medium size projects, comprise the NHS plan commitment to deliver over 100 new hospital schemes between 2000 and 2010.</p>

          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0397P0-06369">"Provision of Acute General Hospital Services" was published in July 1998 by a joint working party of the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Physicians of London and the Royal College of Surgeons of England. It suggested that the ideal unit for a fully comprehensive medicine and surgery is a hospital or integrated group of hospitals serving a population of 450,000 to 500,000. The effective size to provide most of the acute services for medicine and surgery was recommended to be one serving a population of 250,000 to 300,000. These recommendations were made some time ago now and thinking about how to organise services safely and effectively has moved on.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-06370">In particular, the NHS Plan, published in July 2000, set the direction for the future development of hospital services, and Shifting the Balance of Power sited responsibility for local health service with primary care trusts.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-06371">The Department of Health's configuring hospitals project has been examining the complex issues around configuration of acute hospitals over the past few months, and will publish a consultation document shortly. Ultimately, it is for local health services to decide, with their local populations, and in the light of relevant guidance and standards, how acute hospital services should be organised.</p>
