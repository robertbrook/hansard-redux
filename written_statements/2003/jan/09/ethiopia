          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0397P0-04092">Ethiopia remains dependent on food aid year on year. However needs have grown throughout 2002 and the Department for International Development has been continuously monitoring the effects of the drought and contributing to the relief efforts. In 2002 we had committed some &#x00A3;7 million to the ICRC and UN agencies by March. After further monitoring we provided an additional &#x00A3;2 million to ICRC in July and continued to support interventions in response to the unfolding situation. By early December DFID had committed over &#x00A3;17 million bilaterally. In addition we contribute almost 20 per cent. of the EC support. In 2002 this included an October commitment of &#x20AC;23 million for food; &#x20AC;4.2 million for other relief, and the Commission's pledge of emergency food aid programme worth &#x20AC;70 million, made in December, equivalent to about 260,000 metric tonnes, to help meet requirements in the first half of 2003.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-04093">The early warning systems have been indicating that, as a result of poor rains and harvest failure across many parts of the country since about the middle of 2002, many rural communities are likely to face difficulties in 2003. On 7 December, a joint Ethiopian Government/UN appeal was launched for humanitarian assistance in 2003; 11.3 million people were identified as needing more than 1.4 million metric tonnes of food assistance with a further 3 million people requiring close monitoring. The World Food Programme considers current food aid pledges to be sufficient to meet needs until end of this month but there is concern about prospects after that. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said during the Appeal launch that he does not anticipate a repeat of the suffering experienced in 1984 provided support is forthcoming from the international community. We agree with his judgement.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-04094">We are continuing to keep the situation under review, using the reports and assessments made by the Government and international agencies involved. We have also been involved in the frequent in-country dialogue on the humanitarian situation between the Ethiopian Government, other donors and nongovernmental organisations. Overall, the main rainy season ended on time having started late. The harvest is now in, and early indications are that it is 21 per cent. down on average. Recent nutritional data indicates unusual levels of malnutrition for this time of year.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-04095">On the basis of our continuous monitoring and using information from a wide range of sources, we now consider a further substantial UK bilateral humanitarian contribution is timely. We have therefore made a further &#x00A3;15 million available for food-aid

          through the UN World Food Programme. This contribution should continue to help allow greater certainty about food supplies in the months ahead and thus avert a crisis. We hope it will encourage others to act too.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-04096">In the longer-term we are working with the Ethiopian Government and key donors to help tackle some of the deep poverty and underlying causes of food insecurity. For example, we will contribute to improvements in agriculture sector policies and support efforts to increase people's access to markets through improvements in rural transport infrastructure. We will also help to reduce the vulnerability of the poor to drought by promoting the development of safety nets for the predictably food insecure. Pastoralists, who are one of the most vulnerable groups, are an important target group for this work. Our country assistance plan, outlining our proposals for long-term partnership with Ethiopia, is currently in final draft form, having been subject to wide consultations since November. We are holding development talks with the Government on 14 January at which we expect to agree the final version, which will then be published.</p>
