          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0397P0-04030">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) travel advice for Indonesia was today changed.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-04031">Previously it advised against all travel to the country. It now advises against all non-essential travel to Indonesia. The FCO continues to assess that the threat to British nationals and British interests from terrorism throughout Indonesia remains high and that British nationals already in Indonesia should consider leaving if their presence is not essential.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-04032">The decision to change the advice was taken after careful consideration of the latest information, including intelligence. It also brings it into line with the latest advice of the Australian Government. The terrorist threat in Indonesia remains real, and further attacks cannot be ruled out. But account has also been taken of the strengthened Indonesian commitment and actions since Bali to confront the terrorists.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-04033">Since Bali there has been only one significant attack, at a McDonalds restaurant and a car showroom in Makassar, Sulawesi, in December, which killed three Indonesian nationals. A number of anti-terrorist decrees have been passed and some important arrests

          made in respect of the Bali bombings and previous terrorist incidents. The Muslim mass movements are now speaking out against terrorism. The radical cleric Abu Bakar Bashir has been held for police questioning. The Indonesians have also provided more security than before to diplomatic missions and international schools, as well as other non-specifically Western targets, such as shopping malls, entertainment centres and churches.</p><p id="S6CV0397P0-04034">A copy of the latest advice can be found on the FCO web site <a class='resolved-url' href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>.</p>
