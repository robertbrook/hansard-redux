      <outline id='3554787' text="The Minister for Housing and Planning (Keith Hill)&lt;p&gt;The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) is today publishing a draft, for public consultation, of a new Planning Policy Statement (PPS) on Sustainable Development in Rural Areas in England. It is the Government's intention that the new PPS (PPS7) should, in due course, replace existing Planning Policy Guidance note 7 (PPG7),&lt;i&gt;The Countryside&amp;#x2014;Environmental Quality and Economic and Social Development&lt;/i&gt; (published February 1997).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The December 2001 planning Green Paper, &lt;i&gt;Planning&amp;#x2014;delivering a fundamental change,&lt;/i&gt; announced that, as part of its proposals for reforming the planning system, the Government intend to review all its planning policy guidance to see whether it is needed; to seek greater clarity; and to remove from national policy guidance advice on practical implementation and policies which are better expressed at a regional or local level. In line with these proposals, the ODPM, in close consultation with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), carried out a review of PPG7. The conclusion of this review was that there remains a strong requirement for a distinct set of national planning policies that address the particular circumstances of rural areas and the wider countryside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, a consultation draft of new PPS7 has been prepared, setting out key national planning policies for achieving thriving, sustainable rural communities, supporting development that meets the economic, social and recreational needs of all, and protecting the quality of the countryside and its landscapes. The PPS also recognises the importance of supporting a sustainable and diverse agricultural industry, and of the role of the tourism and leisure sectors in rural areas. When, in due course, they are issued in their final form, these policies will inform planning authorities, regional planning bodies and planning inspectors in carrying out their land use planning and development control responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the Government are seeking views on draft PPS7 from a wide range of interested parties. The consultation period will run for twelve weeks, closing on 12 December 2003. Copies of the consultation document are being made available in the Libraries of both Houses.&lt;/p&gt;" title='Planning Policy (Rural Areas)' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/sep/15/planning-policy-rural-areas'></outline>
      <outline id='3554788' text='The Minister for Local Government, Regional Governance and Fire (Mr. Nick Raynsford)&lt;p&gt;Despite above inflation increases in grant for all English local authorities in 2003&amp;#x2013;04, we were disappointed that the&lt;col&gt;38WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;average council tax increase was 12.9 per cent. Having looked at the budget returns from all English authorities, we have considered very carefully whether to use our powers under part IVA of the Local Government Act 1992 to cap any local authority budgets. We have decided against doing so this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every local authority has a responsibility to its own taxpayers and electors. However, the Government are clear that the current trend in council tax rises is not sustainable. We will look at council tax rises very closely next year and we will also want to take account of the trend in increases over more than one year. Local authorities should be aware that we are prepared to use our targeted capping powers in 2004&amp;#x2013;05. In exceptional circumstances I do not rule out the possibility of capping authorities categorised as "good" or "excellent" in the current and future comprehensive performance assessments.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Council Tax' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/sep/15/council-tax'></outline>

      <outline id='3554790' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Paul Goggins)&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce the publication today of the second annual report of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (the MAPPA) of the 42 police and probation Areas in England and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MAPPA have made a significant difference to the way the police and probation protect the public from the risks posed by sexual and other violent offenders. The MAPPA were established by the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 and introduced in April 2001. As a direct result there is now greater consistency and robustness in arrangements to manage these offenders and an increasing involvement of other agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am very pleased that the statutory arrangements we introduced are proving to be so effective. However, there is no room for complacency: to consolidate good practice we have included provision in the Criminal Justice Bill to formalise the involvement of other agencies in this very important area of public protection. I congratulate the police and probation services for their commitment and achievement in developing the MAPPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each annual report contains the number of MAPPA offenders in that Area. The total number has increased; as expected, some offenders remain within the MAPPA longer than a year, some for life or for as long as they present a serious risk of harm to the public. The total number of MAPPA offenders increased 12 per cent. to 52,809, of which 21,413 are registered sex offenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time annual reports contain information about the number of MAPPA offenders referred to the highest level of MAPPA activity&amp;#x2014;the Multi-Agency Public Protection Panels (MAPPPs). Offenders are referred to a MAPPP because they present a particularly high risk or difficulties. In England and Wales 2,843 offenders (5 per cent. of the total) were managed through referral to a MAPPP. Early indications are that the recidivism of offenders managed through MAPPPs is significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S6CV0410P2I0027"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;39WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public protection is one of this Government&apos;s highest priorities and the excellent work the police and probation services have done to improve it through the MAPPA deserves to be widely acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have placed in the Library a copy of each Area report together with other background information about the operation of the MAPPA.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Sexual/Violent Offenders' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/sep/15/sexualviolent-offenders'></outline>

      <outline id='3554792' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Ivor Caplin)&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence has completed its reviews of the current Armed Forces pension and compensation arrangements. We have taken account of views expressed during the public consultation in 2001, in particular those serving in the Armed Forces, those representing the ex-Service community and the recommendations made by the House of Commons Defence Committee in March&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 2002. In reaching our decisions we have also taken account of the changes in policy likely to emerge from the Inland Revenue paper on tax simplification&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Our proposals are also consistent with the policies recently published by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The new schemes are designed to be fairer, to reflect modern practice and to meet the needs of the Armed Forces in the 21st century, and offer a high level of assurance for Service personnel. The Government intends to introduce the primary and secondary legislation required to implement these new schemes as soon as Parliamentary time allows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) will be introduced for new entrants on 6 April 2005 and we will give current members of the Armed Forces the opportunity to transfer to the new scheme as soon as possible, but no later than 6 April 2007. This decision to transfer will be entirely voluntary for each individual member. The new AFPS will remain a defined benefit scheme but will be based on final pensionable pay and will provide the same benefits for officers and other ranks. There are substantial new arrangements for dependants:&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;a death-in-service benefit of four times pensionable pay (increased from up to one and a half times pensionable pay previously);&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;an increase of 25 per cent. in widow(er)&apos;s pension compared to the current scheme;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;an extension of dependants&apos; benefits to unmarried partners where there is a substantial relationship.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes reflect key concerns raised during consultation and address the need to make proper provision for those who are left behind when personnel are killed in service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;HCDC Third Report: The MoD Reviews of Armed Forces Pension and Compensation Arrangements (HC 666)&amp;#x2014; 9 May 2002.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;i&gt;HCDC Fifth Special Report: The MoD Reviews of Armed Forces Pension and Compensation Arrangements: Government&apos;s Response (HC 1115).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;i&gt;Simplifying the taxation of pensions: increasing choice for all (December 2002).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;i&gt;Simplicity, Security and Choice: working and saving for retirement&amp;#x2014;Action on occupational pensions (June 2003).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;40WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheme has retained its normal retirement age of 55, but preserved pensions will be paid at age 65. The current early Immediate Pension provision has been replaced with an Early Departure Scheme, which is expected to ensure compliance with expected revisions to Inland Revenue policy with respect to the earliest date at which normal pension benefits can be paid. The Early Departure Scheme will offer a similar structure of benefits to the Immediate Pension, but with changes which help to fund some improvements in pension benefits and the cost of pensioners living longer. Overall, the changes will be broadly cost-neutral, taking account of the steps taken to cover increasing longevity costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new compensation scheme will be introduced in April 2005 and will replace provisions under the War Pensions Scheme and attributable benefits under the current AFPS for incidents arising from that date. The new scheme reflects modern practice. It is fair, transparent, simple to understand and offers consistent outcomes, with more focus on the more severely disabled. It is a no-fault scheme. It provides a lump sum payment for pain and suffering, which is a new benefit not available under current arrangements. In addition, a Guaranteed Income Stream (GIS) will be awarded alongside higher level tariff awards for those who suffer significant loss of earnings capacity. Unlike the current arrangements, there will be in-service lump sum awards for pain and suffering, including for injuries resulting from war-like activities. Benefits will be provided for dependants where deaths result from service but will be extended to include unmarried partners, where there is a substantial relationship. There will be a time limit to claim of five years, with exceptions for late-onset conditions. Claims will be assessed using the "balance of probabilities" standard of proof, in line with civil law and common practice elsewhere. There will be an independent appeals tribunal system, compliant with European Convention on Human Rights, available for claimants who consider that their claim has not been handled fairly by the MOD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence will also be extending the provisions introduced on 20 March 2003 which provided benefits to unmarried partners for attributable deaths related to conflict. The current AFPS will provide attributable benefits to unmarried partners where there is a substantial relationship for all attributable deaths with an effective date of 15 September 2003. The current AFPS does not provide unmarried partner benefits for non-attributable deaths. but this benefit will be available under the new AFPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am making available more detailed information from the consultation process and further detailed explanation of the Schemes at &lt;u&gt;http://www.mod.uk/ issues/pensions.&lt;/u&gt; A copy will be placed in the Library of the House.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Armed Forces (Pension/Compensation Schemes)' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/sep/15/armed-forces-pensioncompensation-schemes'></outline>

This had involved substantial volcanic ashfalls throughout the island. We and regional donors made immediate assistance available for procurement of emergency ash masks, medical and drinking water supplies, ash clearing equipment and other materials. The Government of Montserrat have since worked quickly and effectively, with our support, to clear ash from most roads and public facilities (schools, hospital etc). However, because the scale of the ashing has been far greater than previously experienced in Montserrat, we are currently helping Montserrat to assess costs and requirements of substantial work needed to complete the clean-up.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Volcanic Activity (Montserrat)' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/sep/15/volcanic-activity-montserrat'></outline>
