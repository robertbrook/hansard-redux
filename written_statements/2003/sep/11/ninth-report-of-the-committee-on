          <p class="first-para">I am today publishing the Government's response to the ninth report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life "Defining the Boundaries within the Executive: Ministers, special advisers and the permanent Civil Service". The Government has considered the<a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_34ws' title='Col. 34WS &mdash; HC Deb 11 September 2003 vol 410 c34WS' name='column_34ws' href='#column_34ws' rel='bookmark'>34WS</a>
          Committee's report with great care, and I would like to place on record my thanks to the Committee for its thorough consideration of these issues. I am pleased to be able to announce the Government accepts the majority of the recommendations. Our response to the main recommendations is as follows:</p><p><span class="italic">Independent Ethics Adviser</span>
          <q>the Government agrees to the appointment of an independent adviser to provide Ministers and Permanent Secretaries with an additional source of professional advice as required on the handling of complex financial issues.</q></p><p><span class="italic"><a href="/acts/civil-service-act">Civil Service Act</a></span>
          <q>the Government commits itself to publishing a draft bill for consultation once the Public Administration Select Committee's proposals for a Civil Service Act have been published.</q></p><p><span class="italic">Special advisers</span>
          <q>the Government proposes a new section to the Code of Conduct for Special Advisers to clarify relationships between special advisers and permanent civil servants. An amendment to the Code is annexed to the Government's response.</q></p><p><span class="italic">First Civil Service Commissioner</span>
          <q>the Government agrees that, in future, the appointment of the First Civil Service Commissioner will be made following consultation with the Leaders of the main opposition parties.</q></p><p><span class="italic">Appointments</span>
          <q>the response makes clear that the Government is committed to maintaining a permanent and impartial Civil Service where selection is made on merit on the basis of fair and open competition. It also acknowledges the important role of the Civil Service Commissioners in the recruitment processes and in upholding the core values of the Civil Service. The response commits the Government to discussions with the Civil Service Commissioners to consider whether the different approaches to Civil Service and public appointments continue to be justified.</q></p><p>Copies of the Government's response [Cm5964] have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
