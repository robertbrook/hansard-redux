          <p class="first-para">Following changes made to the <a href="/bills/regional-assemblies-preparations-bill">Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Bill</a>, I am writing today to all Members in the English regions outside London to follow up my earlier letter about the soundings exercise on the level of interest in holding a referendum about establishing an elected regional assembly. Voters in two-tier local authority areas will now have a say about the form of unitary local government relating to their area that would be introduced if an elected assembly is established.</p><p>Those who have already responded to this exercise are also being contacted again. In both cases, we are making it clear that we will consider further evidence or comments if people's views have changed in light of the amendments. We do not expect this to cause many people to change their minds about their response to the soundings exercise, but if people have changed their minds we would be happy to receive further views, information and evidence on this matter. If their response remains the same, they do not need to take any action-their original response will be considered as before. Additionally, any individual or organisation who did not previously submit comments, but now wishes to put forward views, information or evidence on the level of interest in a referendum can do so.</p><p>Copies of the revised pro-forma have been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses. They are also available from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website via <a class='resolved-url' href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk">http://www.odpm.gov.uk</a>. Responses to this additional phase of the soundings exercise are requested by 16 May, since the Secretary of State is likely to take his decision shortly after that.</p>
