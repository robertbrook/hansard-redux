          <p class="first-para">On 27 February I announced (<span class="italic">Official Report,</span> 26WS) that we had been considering the timetable for the forthcoming consultation about night restrictions at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted Airports and that we had decided to consult shortly on an interim proposal to extend the present night restrictions regime at those airports for a further year, to October 2005. This consultation paper is published today.</p><p>The policy background to the night flying restrictions at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted is changing. New European Community legislation is coming into effect; the Government is awaiting the outcome of a long running European Court of Human Rights case about an earlier night restrictions regime at Heathrow Airport; and we are continuing with our major consultation "The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: South East" which refers to aspects of night noise policy.</p><p>In view of these developments, as the consultation paper explains, we propose to continue the current night restrictions regime at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted for a further year, until 30 October 2005. We propose that the movements limits and noise quota for both the winter and summer seasons remain the same as for the respective seasons for each airport in the year from 26 October 2003 to 31 October 2004.</p><p>The consultation paper also commences consideration of some of the general principles and policies underlying the night restrictions; in particular, the present policy of having common arrangements at all three airports and the broad issues relating to the possible extension of the night quota period (currently 2330&#x2013;0600).</p><p>It also explains how we intend to take forward the results of two reviews relating to the classification of aircraft for night restrictions purposes and how we intend to take forward the results of a separate review of the departure noise limits and the related noise monitoring arrangements.</p><p>The consultation will close on 11 July. Copies of the consultation paper are available in the House Library. All responses will be taken into account. Subject to those responses, we aim to announce our decision on the proposals for 2004&#x2013;05, by 31 October 2003. Responses on other matters covered in this consultation paper will

          be taken into account in developing proposals for the next night restrictions regime for consultation, in due course. They will also be taken into account as appropriate in the forthcoming Air Transport White Paper.</p>
