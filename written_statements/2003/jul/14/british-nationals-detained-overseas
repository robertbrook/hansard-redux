          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0409P0-02282">As part of a wider review of how we make the most effective use of our Consular resources to help British nationals in distress overseas, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has considered the issue of visiting British nationals in prison overseas.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02283">The welfare of British nationals in foreign prisons is one of the key concerns of consular staff. Our staff seek to ensure that prisoners' rights are respected in accordance with international standards. This includes ensuring that they have access to legal representation and that their welfare needs are met during their detention.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02284">Once a British national has been given a custodial sentence, our aim has been to visit them once a year, or more frequently if possible.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_10ws' title='Col. 10WS &mdash; HC Deb 14 July 2003 vol 409 c10WS' name='column_10ws' href='#column_10ws' rel='bookmark'>10WS</a><p id="S6CV0409P0-02285">This approach does not however take account of the wide variation in prison conditions and practices between different countries. In European Union countries, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, North America and Australasia, we are satisfied that, in general, prison conditions meet international standards and are comparable to those in the UK. From 1 September this year, our aim will therefore be to visit prisoners in these countries once after sentencing, and thereafter, only if the real need arises. In addition, consular staff can maintain contact with prisoners by telephone and fax and encourage local prison volunteer groups to visit them.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02286">In all other countries, where prison conditions give us more cause for concern, the aim of consular staff will be to continue to visit prisoners on a regular basis. This is likely to be at least once a year, and as often as once a month where circumstances warrant it. The new policy will allow us to provide our consular services on the basis of greatest need and to concentrate on countries where our consular assistance can be most beneficial.</p>
