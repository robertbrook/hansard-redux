          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0409P0-02491">I am happy to inform the House that I am today publishing the latest edition of the<span class="italic">Forward Look</span> of Government-funded science, engineering and technology (SET). The Forward Look is the Government's publication of Government-funded SET and R&D expenditure data compiled by the Office for National Statistics. Forward Look highlights the outcome of the latest spending review as well as historical trends in government expenditure.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02492">The theme for <span class="italic">Forward Look 2003</span> is "making a difference". Entries from departments, Research Councils, learned bodies and devolved administrations set out to explain, with examples of tangible outcomes, how SET is helping them deliver policy and public services in their priority areas.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02493"><span class="italic">Forward Look 2003</span> also aims to illustrate how the economy and society can benefit from science and technology, as we explore new areas of science and look for ways of exploiting technology. It helps Government in its efforts to engage the public in a meaningful way to learn about and express their views about the possible directions of science and its impacts on society. <span class="italic">Forward Look 2003</span> will be of value to all of us interested in science, and government-funded research and science policy in particular. The accompanying tables provide an authoritative reference point to where government research spending his been going, what it is being used to achieve and where future spending is to be focused.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02494"><span class="italic">Forward Look 2003</span> shows that there has been a further substantial increase in the overall Science Budget as a result of the 2002 Spending Review, with the Research Councils receiving new funding to increase the volume of top quality research and to take forward specific new projects.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02495"><span class="italic">Forward Look 2003</span> sets out in detail how the Government's significant investment in science is being spent. Funding for science, engineering and technology is increasing from &#x00A3;8.46 billion in 2002&#x2013;03 to &#x00A3;8.61 billion in 2004&#x2013;05 in real terms. In particular we are focusing on investing in our excellent science base, because cutting edge science is at the heart of a successful economy.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_47ws' title='Col. 47WS &mdash; HC Deb 16 July 2003 vol 409 c47WS' name='column_47ws' href='#column_47ws' rel='bookmark'>47WS</a><p id="S6CV0409P0-02496">Copies of <span class="italic">Forward Look 2003</span> have been placed in the Library of the House and have also been sent to the Clerks of both the Commons and Lords Science and Technology Committees.</p>
