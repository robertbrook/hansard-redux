          <p class="first-para">I represented the United Kingdom at the Ministerial Meeting of the OSPAR Commission for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic and the joint Ministerial Meeting between OSPAR and the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) for the Protection of the Baltic Sea.</p><p>The OSPAR meeting reviewed and updated the strategies that direct key areas of its work and aim to deliver a healthy and sustainable marine environment for the North East Atlantic within one generation. These strategies cover hazardous substances, eutrophication, biodiversity, radioactive substances and offshore oil and gas. The meeting also adopted a new programme for assessment and monitoring to prepare for the next overall assessment of the OSPAR maritime area in 2010 and to monitor progress made in implementing other strategies.</p><p>Key outcomes include the approval of the results of the first application of the Common Procedure for assessing the eutrophication status of the OSPAR maritime area, the adoption of criteria for the identification of habitats and species in need of protection and the selection of 27 species and 10 types of habitat to be protected, OSPAR guidance on developing offshore wind energy and an agreement on sand and gravel extraction. Agreement was also reached on establishing a baseline from which progress in delivering the radioactive substances strategy will be measured.</p><p>Five recommendations were adopted better to protect the marine environment. These cover (1) controlling the dispersal of mercury emissions from crematoria; (2) to promote the use and implementation of environmental management systems by the offshore oil and gas industry; (3) a network of marine protected areas: (4) a framework for reporting encounters with marine dumped conventional and chemical munitions; and (5) the strategy for the Joint Assessment and Monitoring Programme.</p><p>The joint HELCOM/OSPAR meeting agreed a declaration and supporting statements on how OSPAR and HELCOM can work together better to protect the North East Atlantic and the Baltic Sea.

          Thematic Strategy, development of the ecosystem approach to managing human activities in the marine environment, and agreement to a joint work programme to establish an ecologically coherent network of well-managed marine protected areas by 2010. The declaration also notes issues of concern on the environmental impacts of fisheries and shipping and makes suggestions for further co-operation to address these.</p><p>Overall both meetings were very successful in developing action and promoting co-operation better to protect and manage the marine environment.</p><p>I have placed copies of the OSPAR and HELCOM/ OSPAR Ministerial Statements in the Library of the House, together with copies of the revised OSPAR Strategies, the five OSPAR Recommendations adopted, and the three HELCOM/OSPAR supporting statements.
