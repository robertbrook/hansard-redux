        Research published today by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister shows the policy in PPG3 has generally been well-integrated into forward planning and development control processes. But there is evidence that necessary housing development has been delayed in some areas.

        The planning system must enable the provision of new homes in the right place and at the right time, whether through new development or the conversion of existing buildings. This is important not only to ensure that everyone has the opportunity of a decent home but also to avoid constraining economic growth and the delivery of quality public services.

        maintain an up-to-date understanding of the likely housing requirements of their areas, and have regard to Government policy to reduce volatility in the housing market and promote macro-economic stability as part of delivering sustainable development. Regional planning bodies should prepare regional planning guidance, and local planning authorities prepare plans, with the aim of providing sufficient housing opportunities to meet the likely housing requirements of their areas. And in doing so, there should be a choice of sites which are both suitable and available for housebuilding.
