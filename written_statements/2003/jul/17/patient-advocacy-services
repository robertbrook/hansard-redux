          <cite class='member author entry-title'><a href="/people/ms-rosie-winterton" title="Ms Rosie Winterton">The Minister of State, Department of Health (Ms Rosie Winterton)</a></cite>
          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0409P0-02652">Section 12 of the <a href="/acts/health-and-social-care-act-2001">Health and Social Care Act</a> (2001) places a legal duty on the Secretary of State to make arrangements to provide independent advocacy services to assist individuals making complaints against the National Health Service. We intend to commence this section on 1 September 2003.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02653">Our intention is to deliver arrangements for a national independent complaints advocacy service (ICAS). These intentions were set out in written answers given to the hon. Member for Eltham (Clive Efford) on <a href="/written_answers/2003/mar/19/nhs-litigation-authority#column_849w">19 March 2003, <span class="italic">Official Report</span>, columns 849&#x2013;51W</a>. The new service will be provided by four contractors who will deliver ICAS across England from the 1 September 2003 on a one year contract. These contractors are The Carers Federation Ltd, POhWER, South East Advocacy Projects and the Citizens Advice.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02654">Delivering ICAS through these contracts will allow primary care trust patients' forums, who will in due course have delegated power to commission or provide ICAS under the <a href="/acts/nhs-reform-and-healthcare-professions-act-2002">NHS Reform and Healthcare Professions Act 2002</a>, time to establish their networks and capacity.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_73ws' title='Col. 73WS &mdash; HC Deb 17 July 2003 vol 409 c73WS' name='column_73ws' href='#column_73ws' rel='bookmark'>73WS</a><p id="S6CV0409P0-02655">Learning from the experience of community health councils and ICAS pilot projects this will be a completely new service that will provide consistent support to patients with complaints about the NHS across England. ICAS will be provided to standards piloted across the country. The commission for patient and public involvement in health (CPPIH) will, as indicated in its functions in the <a href="/acts/nhs-reform-and-healthcare-professions-act-2002">NHS Reform and Healthcare Professions Act 2002</a>, monitor ICAS services against the standards.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02656">We have worked with the CPPIH to set in place arrangements for them to act as the Department's agents to manage these interim contracts on our behalf. We intend shortly to lay amendments to the CPPIH regulations to reflect this additional function.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02657">The new ICAS providers will begin recruiting staff and preparing publicity for patients, and others, during July and August for the commencement of the service on 1 September 2003. We will be notifying our partners in the NHS about the new arrangements so that they can offer the contractors full co-operation before, and during, the contracts and help direct patients to the new service.</p>
