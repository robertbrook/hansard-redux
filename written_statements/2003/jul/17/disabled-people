          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0409P0-02589">The New Deal for Disabled People will be extended for a further two years to 31 March 2006. All existing Job Brokers will have the opportunity to participate in this extended programme, but they will be required to meet the new standards of performance and conform to a revised service design that builds on best practice under the existing programme and emerging lessons from the evaluation and experience under other similar programmes including Employment Zones.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_66ws' title='Col. 66WS &mdash; HC Deb 17 July 2003 vol 409 c66WS' name='column_66ws' href='#column_66ws' rel='bookmark'>66WS</a><p id="S6CV0409P0-02590">Job Brokers will be expected to develop rigorous and appropriate back to work plans to support individual in return for an initial &#x00A3;300 payment for the registration of new customers. We will also be bringing the sustained outcome payments into line with other programmes by making payments after individual have been in work for 13 weeks and not 26 weeks as currently. Job Brokers will still be expected, however to provide ongoing support over at least the first 6 months of employment and we will review the effectiveness of their arrangements through our contract management system and through the evaluation of the programme.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02591">To participate in this extension Job Brokers will need to demonstrate that they can meet challenging performance targets, in particular in moving people into work. Those Brokers who can demonstrate an ability to meet high levels of performance will have the opportunity to expand their services; and at the same time we will be offering limited, geographically focused opportunities for new providers to enter the programme. Further details about the terms on which extended contracts will be let and upon which no, providers might be able to deliver services will b published in the autumn.</p>
