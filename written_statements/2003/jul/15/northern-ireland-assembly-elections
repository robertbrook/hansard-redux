          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0409P0-02298">I am announcing today the publication of the Northern Ireland Assembly Elections (Registered Parties and Candidates) Reimbursement Scheme 2003 in accordance with section 3 of the <a href="/acts/northern-ireland-assembly-elections-and-periods-of-suspension-act-2003">Northern Ireland Assembly (Elections and Periods of Suspension) Act 2003</a>. The scheme has been finalised following the submission to me of a number of recommendations by the Electoral Commission. I am pleased to say that all the recommendations meet the provisions of the Act.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02299">I have the authority under Section 3 of the Act to make payments, in the form of a scheme, to registered political parties, in connection with their campaign expenditure and candidates, in connection with their election expenses. These parties and candidates would have contested the Northern Ireland Assembly election due on 29 May 2003 but postponed by the Act.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_14ws' title='Col. 14WS &mdash; HC Deb 15 July 2003 vol 409 c14WS' name='column_14ws' href='#column_14ws' rel='bookmark'>14WS</a><p id="S6CV0409P0-02300">I will be writing to the Northern Ireland political parties today to inform them that I have published a scheme. The Electoral Commission will also write to the parties to give them full details of the scheme including clear explanatory notes.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02301">Although I will be responsible for making payments to parties and candidates following recommendations made by the Electoral Commission, it will be the Commission who will have day-to-day responsibility for operating the scheme. The Commission will only recommend that a payment be made once it is satisfied that a party or candidate would have contested the May election and that the expenditure or expenses being claimed are in accordance with the requirements of the scheme. Claims will only be considered if they are sent to the Commission by 30 September 2003 at the latest and accompanied by the declarations required by the scheme and evidence to support the value of the claim. The Commission will also have the authority to verify all claims by asking for further information, explanations or inspections of documents or goods and property.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02302">I am very grateful to the Commission for its help in putting the scheme together.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02303">I have placed copies of the scheme in both Libraries.</p>
