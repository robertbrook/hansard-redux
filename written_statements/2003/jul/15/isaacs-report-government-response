          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0409P0-02356">We are publishing today our response to the Isaacs Report, which followed an investigation by Her Majesty's Inspector of Anatomy, Dr Jeremy Metters CB. We advised the House about the publication of the Isaacs Report in a written Ministerial statement on 12 May.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02357">The Inspector's report addressed the case of the late Mr. Cyril Mark Isaacs and the retention of his brain for research purposes following a Coroner's post mortem in 1987 without the knowledge or consent of his widow, Mrs. Elaine Isaacs. Mr. Isaacs's case proved to be part of an arrangement whereby the' coroner's office in north Manchester would identify brains suitable for a research programme at Manchester university. The Inspector also found evidence that brains were used following post mortems on adults in other locations.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02358">The report made 34 specific recommendations that bear on the responsibilities of the Department, the Home Office and the Department for Education and Skills. We have considered these carefully and we are today publishing our joint response and copies have been placed in the Library.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02359">I pay tribute once again to Mrs. Elaine Isaacs for bringing her husband's case to public attention and to Dr. Metters for his thorough investigation and report. We are very grateful to the Retained Organs Commission and to National Health Service trusts for the arrangements they put in place to deal with inquiries from the public arising from the publication of the report. I understand that the Commission's helpline has

          taken over 860 calls and, of these, some 580 were specific inquiries about organ retention from a deceased person which are being passed to the relevant NHS trusts for investigation.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02360">While there is still work to be done, the programme of action on the removal, retention and use of human organs and tissue that we have put in hand since we accepted recommendations by the Chief Medical Officer in 2001 has already achieved significant improvements. Following extensive consultation, we published on 25 April a comprehensive, interim framework of guidance and other materials to reflect transparent new systems founded on consent. The interim framework comprises: a statement on the use of human tissue and organs under the current law, a code of practice 'Families and Post-mortems', post-mortem consent forms and leaflets, a code of practice on import/export of human body parts and a summary report on the responses to the consultation document "Human Bodies Human Choices". Steps have also been taken to modernise the practice of pathology and to improve the management of joint NHS and academic posts. In addition, the inquiry findings will be taken into account in the development of relevant policy initiatives bearing on death investigation and coronial services which are currently being taken forward by the Home Office.</p><p id="S6CV0409P0-02361">We also intend to bring forward legislation establishing a comprehensive new framework for the removal retention and use of organs and tissue from both adults and children as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>
