      <outline id='3515928' text="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Caroline Flint)&lt;p&gt;I wish to announce changes in the way in which the Home Office handles certain types of project licence applications made under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The types of application in question are publicly recorded as being automatically referred to the Animal Procedures Committee (APC) for advice, before decisions are taken by or on behalf of the Secretary of State. For some types, this is in accordance with pledges given when the 1986 Act was passing through Parliament, while others are referred through arrangements agreed subsequently. Details are set out in various APC annual reports laid before both Houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The APC has recently been considering which applications should be referred to it in future, and the chairman has put a number of recommendations to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The APC recommends that three types of application, on which it is currently committed to give advice, no longer need to be among those listed as routinely referred to it. First, it no longer sees value in considering applications to use terminally anaesthetised rats for microsurgery training, since such cases are few and usually raise no particularly difficult or contentious issues. Secondly, it now sees no point in including in the automatic referral category applications to test tobacco products, since the established policy and practice has long been not to license such testing. (Tobacco is used in licensed animal studies investigating diseases, but its use in such cases is not itself regarded as a reason for referral.) Thirdly, the requirement to refer applications to test finished cosmetic products and ingredients has been similarly overtaken, in that the industry has agreed to make no further applications for this purpose, as it is Home Office policy not to license it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have accepted the APC's recommendations as regards all these types of applications. They will with immediate effect no longer be regarded as ones to be automatically referred or to be recorded in that category. This change will make no significant or practical difference, other than saving processing time in the microsurgery training cases and avoiding unproductive use of Home Office and APC resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The APC has also recommended that it should continue its current practice of advising on all the other applications that are by agreement referred to it as a matter of course. These are applications to use wild caught non-human primates, and to use any non-human primates in scientific procedures of substantial severity. It also wishes to keep the requirement that it should offer advice on applications of any kind raising novel or controversial issues, or giving rise to serious concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;136WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there are relatively few of these applications, they are all of high or potentially high public concern. I fully accept that they should continue to be referred to the APC before licensing decisions are taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the APC has indicated its view that it could usefully see other project licence applications, though it could consider only a very small number each year and is mindful of the need not to hold up unduly the processing of applications. Which additional applications it should he asked to advise on is a matter to be discussed further between the Home Office and the APC. Once that has been settled, I will make a further statement.&lt;/p&gt;" title='Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/dec/17/animals-scientific-procedures-act-1986'></outline>

In particular, it describes the flexibilities it has in terms of financial and human resource management. It also sets out it responsibilities to its customers and its accountability to the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor and to Parliament. The Document has been produced following a major review of Land Registry's status and business operations in 2000. The report of that review was published in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 13 October, the Land Registration Act 2002 was implemented signalling the most significant legislative reform for Land Registry since 1925.

We have considered the report in detail and undertaken in-depth consultation. The Government accept the majority of the Committee&apos;s recommendations and is already implementing some of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key features of the Government&apos;s response are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Undertaking a review of public bodies sponsored by central government&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government agree with the Committee that the variety and complexity of public bodies supports the need for a review of their definition and scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ensuring that information about Non Departmental Public Bodies is in the public domain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government support the need for details of public bodies within the remit of Central Government to be in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Commissioner for Public Appointments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government agree with the Committee that the Commissioner is central to the integrity and good practice of public appointments. The Government will examine the Public Appointments Order in Council to see whether it needs to be strengthened in order that the independence of the Commissioner is assured. It will also update the schedule to the Order providing a definitive list of appointments regulated by the Commissioner. The Government do not agree with the recommendation that the Commissioner should be made solely responsible for appointing independent&#x000A;&lt;image src="S6CV0415P2I0094"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;139WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;assessors, but will explore further with the Commissioner how current arrangements operate to ensure that they are as robust as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diversity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government accept a number of recommendations designed to encourage and improve diversity in public appointments including developing and piloting shadowing, mentoring and board development schemes for groups that are currently under-represented on boards of public bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Public Appointments Commission&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government believe that it would be immensely difficult for a single body to cope with the diverse range of Non-Departmental Public Bodies and maintain that individual departments should continue to be responsible for appointments they sponsor. The Government recognise the value of having central teams in departments to advise on public appointments and work with sponsor teams. It also recognises that the NHS Appointments Commission is working well and some departments could benefit from using its services. The Government will be exploring this further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copies of the Government&apos;s response (Cm 6056) have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.&lt;/p&gt;' title='"Government by Appointment: Opening Up the Patronage State"' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/dec/17/government-by-appointment-opening-up-the'></outline>

This explains what each central Government department is doing to increase diversity on the boards of their public bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report includes action plans for each department as well as details of progress to date. It also includes targets to increase the proportion of appointments held by women, people from ethnic minority backgrounds and disabled people to be achieved by 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government has two fundamental commitments that apply to public appointments. The first is that selection should be made on merit, using fair and open procedures that ensure the best available candidate is appointed to each post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second is a commitment to improving diversity in public appointments and recognition that the boards of public bodies will be most effective if they benefit from access to a wide range of skills, experience and backgrounds among their members. In particular, the Government is committed to the equal representation of women and men in public appointments; pro rata representation of members of ethnic minority groups and increased participation of disabled people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is keen to ensure that these commitments are met and that those serving on public bodies are representative of society as a whole. Progress has been made. But there is still much more to be done.

      <outline id='3515958' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr. Chris Mullin)&lt;p&gt;The UN panel on the Illegal Exploitation of the Natural Resources of the Democratic Republic of Congo has now completed its work. It addressed one of the central and most contentious issues of the conflict in the DRC: the link between the causes of the conflict and the exploitation of natural resources. The panel&apos;s final report contains a number of important recommendations about how both the Congolese people and the international community should better manage the exploitation of resources to benefit the people of the DRC. Without losing sight of what has gone on before and the need for justice in appropriate cases, we need to build on many of its positive recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S6CV0415P2I0095"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;141WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;We agree with the panel, that the international community must support the Transitional National Government (TNG) in the DRC. We are already working with the new government in Congo and with international and regional partners to help develop its institutions and to put in place effective management of the country&apos;s natural resources. The huge potential of the Congo&apos;s natural resources should be exploited legally and in a regulated way, for the benefit of all Congolese. We want to see trade in natural resources become a cohesive factor in regional stability and not a cause of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are playing a leading role in helping the TNG make effective its anti-corruption commission. We are helping the new Government adhere to the Kimberley process on the regulated trade in diamonds, which is the country&apos;s most significant export. We have funded Global Witness to research and publish an independent preliminary report on resource exploitation, and we are planning to fund further research in this field. We are talking to the TNG about the extractive industries transparency initiative, which the Prime Minister launched in February 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are also engaged in promoting confidence building measures in the region. We welcome the declaration on good neighbourliness made by the Governments of Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and the DRC in New York on 25 September, which includes that there must be no illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the DRC. We encourage the states concerned to continue to follow this up with steps to address bilateral and multilateral issues of mutual concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illegal exploitation of resources in the DRC has served to fuel the conflict by funding arms flows. We need to ensure that the arms embargo on groups operating in the DRC is effectively implemented and monitored. We are playing a leading role through our mission in New York in supporting proposals for an arms embargo monitoring mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as looking forward, we need to address what has happened in the past. We take seriously the allegations made against the British companies named in the report. We have already pursued these allegations: the Department of Trade and Industry, as national contact point for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines has scrutinised the dossiers referred to it by the UN panel and has been in contact with the named companies or their representatives to discuss the allegations. Her Majesty&apos;s Customs and Excise have studied the UN panel&apos;s papers relating to the UK companies named in the report, but have been unable to take matters further, due to lack of evidence which would be sufficient to mount a criminal investigation. We are disappointed that despite numerous appeals to the panel to furnish detailed information to substantiate its allegations, we have not received any such information. We cannot now pursue the cases named in the report further without more specific information. There is so far no evidence that named companies have breached either OECD guidelines or UK law. We continue to ask the UN to supply us with the information on which the panel based its allegations. We also urge the non-governmental organisation community to submit any specific information it may have to the national contact point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;142WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;We continue to press regional states to investigate and, where appropriate, take action on the allegations made in the panel reports. In this respect we welcome the publication of the conclusions of the commission of inquiry established by the Ugandan Government. We remain in close contact with the Government of Uganda on follow-up work to the commission&apos;s report. We also welcome the establishment of a judicial commission by the Rwandan Government and urge it to publicise the results of its investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel&apos;s final report included a section which the panel chose not to make public, but which was submitted on a confidential basis to the Security Council. It is not appropriate for us to comment on this, but as far as we are aware, none of the companies or individuals named in the confidential section is of British nationality.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Democratic Republic of Congo' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/dec/17/democratic-republic-of-congo'></outline>
