          <p class="first-para">The White Paper, "Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain" published in February 2002, set out the Government's proposals for enhancing the significance of the acquisition of British citizenship. The <a href="/acts/nationality-immigration-and-asylum-act-2002">Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</a> duly<a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_78ws' title='Col. 78WS &mdash; HC Deb 09 December 2003 vol 415 c78WS' name='column_78ws' href='#column_78ws' rel='bookmark'>78WS</a>
          included provisions which, when brought into force at the start of 2004, will require all adult applicants for British citizenship to take an oath of allegiance to Her Majesty The Queen and pledge of loyalty to the United Kingdom at a citizenship ceremony.</p><p>On 25 July we published a consultation document which set out the Government's provisional views on the form and content of that citizenship ceremony. The 12-week period of consultation closed on 17 October and 145 responses were received.</p><p>Broadly, the responses supported the proposal that national symbols such as the Union flag and national anthem should feature in ceremonies throughout the United Kingdom and that these should be augmented with local features and symbols. A small minority of responses did not support the idea. The Government remain strongly of the view that it would be right for these United Kingdom symbols to be used, given that the citizenship being bestowed is that of the United Kingdom as a whole. Other countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand certainly believe it appropriate to display national symbols at these events. We would encourage those who disagree to reflect further and to consider this issue from the viewpoint of the new citizens and what they might reasonably expect of a British citizenship ceremony, rather than impose their own views on what is appropriate.</p><p>There was a positive response to the suggestion that local authorities might wish to impart their own flavour on ceremonies taking place in their area, and to the notion that prominent and recognised members of the local community might take part in ceremonies and formally welcome new citizens to their area. The suggestions on what form this local flavour might take recognised the importance of local adaptations not detracting from the dignified, celebratory and meaningful nature that the Government intend for citizenship ceremonies. Many areas proposed that they would involve local schools and community groups in their ceremonies.</p><p>In terms of the musical content of ceremonies, the majority supported the playing of the national anthem immediately after the taking of the oath and pledge. Many areas said that they also intended to play recognised and appropriate pieces of music as new citizens entered and left the ceremony. A list will be given in the guidance for local authorities and registrars.</p><p>The consultation document proposed a form of words for the ceremony welcome speech and for the address given by the local dignitary. The majority of responses supported the notion of standardisation of the main portions of these addresses, but said that they would ensure that any local additions did not detract from the formal welcome to both the UK and the local area.</p><p>In terms of a commemorative gift, most thought that a commemorative certificate bearing that area's coat of arms or logo would be most appropriate. There was a unanimous view that any gift given must be meaningful of the event. A small percentage of respondents took the view that there was no need for a gift as such in that the grant of citizenship was in itself a gift.</p><p>The Government are grateful to all of those individuals and organisation who took the time to read and respond to this document.

          comments give us reason to believe that our proposals carry general support. We shall therefore proceed broadly in line with the format set out in the consultation document. The cost of the ceremonies will be included in an increased nationality fee, the details of which have been included in a statutory instrument to be laid today, which will mean no additional charge to the taxpayer. Details are in the table:
