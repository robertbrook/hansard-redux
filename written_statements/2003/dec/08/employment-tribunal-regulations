          <p class="first-para">This consultation covers the Government's proposals for revisions to the Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure) Regulations. Views are being invited from stakeholders on these proposed changes.</p><p>It is intended that the new regulations will be laid in spring 2004 and come into force in October 2004.</p><p>The aim of the revisions is to streamline procedures in order to promote the early settlement of cases through ACAS conciliation and, where that fails, to expedite the passage of cases through the Tribunal system.</p><p>The changes arise from provisions of the <a href="/acts/employment-act-2002">Employment Act 2002</a>, from recommendations of the Employment Tribunal System Taskforce, and from suggestions offered by the Employment Tribunal Presidents&#x2014;for England and Wales and for Scotland&#x2014;to help make the system run more smoothly. The revisions are designed to deliver a better service and swifter justice for all, and include, amongst other things, the adoption of a new pre-acceptance procedure for both claimants and respondents, and a re-structuring and re-writing of the Rules in plain English.</p><p>These proposed tribunal regulations form part of an overall package of measures. They take account of, and dovetail with, the new dispute resolution regulations being introduced by the Government to encourage settlement of disputes in the workplace. The Government also intends to revise the Employment Appeal Tribunal rules to a similar timescale.</p><p>In preparing the revised Regulations, DTI has been working closely with a wide range of stakeholders, including the judicial Presidents, the Employment Tribunals Service arid ACAS. Representatives of businesses and the trade unions have also been involved in the preliminary consultation process. These and other bodies will now, through this formal public consultation, have a further opportunity to offer views on the way the revised regulations are to be taken forward and to ensure that the procedures of the Employment Tribunals deliver fairness and justice to all.</p>
