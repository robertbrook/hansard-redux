          <p class="first-para">The BBC's Royal Charter&#x2014;the seventh in the history of the corporation&#x2014;is due to expire on 31 December 2006. I have today launched the first phase of a process of review that will result in a strong BBC, independent of Government, from the end of the current Charter and beyond. That period will be marked by continuing rapid advances in technology, and changes in society, culture and practice&#x2014;the way people receive and make use of broadcast content. Charter review will

          be characterised by our openness, our efforts to engage as broad a section of the population as we can, and our commitment to listen to what people have to say. And I am being helped in this by Lord Burns, who will provide me with independent advice throughout.</p><p>Charter review is not a single process. It will take in a range of existing and planned work, including Ofcom's review of public service television, the independent review of BBC online and the forthcoming reviews of the BBC's new digital services.</p><p>But it will also feature widespread public involvement, built around a three-phase process of consultation. Phase one starts today, based on a very broad consultation document&#x2014;The Review of the BBC's Royal Charter&#x2014;which I have published today. I have placed copies of the document&#x2014;and a supporting leaflet&#x2014;in the Libraries of both Houses.</p><p>Phase two, timed to begin around the end of 2004, will aim to bring together the results of phase one, the conclusions of various reviews taking place over the course of next year and the findings of our own programme of research into a green paper, which will be published for a further stage of consultation.</p><p>A White Paper will follow, with a further round of consultation. We will conclude the process with a full and formal opportunity for both Houses to contribute their views.</p><p>Today's publication forms the central plank of phase one. It sets out a framework for consultation&#x2014;based on a series of key themes&#x2014;within which there is plenty of room for discussion of all aspects of the BBC's role, structure and function. The consultation will be supported by a programme of survey research and direct engagement with the public and stakeholders.</p><p>The BBC belongs to everyone. It is one of our most valued institutions. In many ways, it reflects what is best about the values, culture and society of the United Kingdom, at home and abroad. Charter review gives the whole country an opportunity to have its say about the kind of BBC it wants for the future.</p>
