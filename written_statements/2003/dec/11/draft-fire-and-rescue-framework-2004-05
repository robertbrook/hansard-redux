          <p class="first-para">In June the Government published the White Paper, "Our Fire and Rescue Service". It set out a package of reforms designed to improve the service and to save more lives. Today the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is publishing a draft fire and rescue national framework that will outline how to implement the White Paper's proposals. It sets out the Government's objectives for the Fire and Rescue Service and what Fire and Rescue Authorities should do to achieve these outcomes. It also sets out what the Government will do to improve the service and what support it will provide to Fire and<a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_98ws' title='Col. 98WS &mdash; HC Deb 11 December 2003 vol 415 c98WS' name='column_98ws' href='#column_98ws' rel='bookmark'>98WS</a>
          Rescue Authorities. In due course, the expectations in the Framework will also help to shape the Audit Commission's fire and rescue Comprehensive Performance Assessment.</p><p>The Framework is based on a partnership approach. The Government is committed to giving Fire and Rescue Authorities adequate support and flexibility to help them meet the specific needs of their local communities. For this reason we are initially issuing it in draft form and welcome comments and suggestions by 12 March 2004 both on the proposals in the draft Framework and on how to make the future versions as helpful and relevant as possible. We aim to publish the first National Framework in Spring 2004.</p><p>The legislation announced in the Queen's speech will place the Framework on a statutory footing. It will require the Government to report to Parliament on the extent to which Fire and Rescue Authorities are acting in accordance with the National Framework and any steps the Government has taken to ensure that they do.</p><p>We are also today publishing Mott MacDonald's most recent study into fire and rescue control rooms, and HM Fire Service Inspectorate's review of the subject. The study reinforced the report's conclusions that regional control rooms would significantly enhance national resilience. The Government is persuaded by the conclusions of the study and proposes to establish regional control rooms in England, including the one already established in London, working closely with Fire and Rescue Authorities through their Regional Management Boards. We have written to the Practitioners Forum asking for their views on our proposed approach.</p><p>The Fire and Rescue Service is, rightly, widely admired for its professionalism and the dedication of its staff. The White Paper made clear, however, that it was also in need of urgent reform. Publication of the draft National Framework sets out the Government's expectations of the Service, what Fire and Rescue Authorities should do and the support the Government will provide. It demonstrates the Government's continued commitment, in partnership with Fire and Rescue Authorities, to driving down the number of fire deaths and injuries, improving fire and rescue services and saving more lives.</p><p>Copies of the Draft Fire and Rescue National Framework 2004/05, the full Mott MacDonald report, the summary of the Mott MacDonald report, and the HM Fire Service Inspectorate review are available in the libraries of both Houses.</p>
