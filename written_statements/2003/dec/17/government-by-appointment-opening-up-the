          <p class="first-para">I have today published the Government's response to the Fourth Report of the Public Administration Select Committee, "Government by Appointment: Opening Up the Patronage State."</p><p>I am grateful for the Committee's comprehensive and helpful report. We have considered the report in detail and undertaken in-depth consultation. The Government accept the majority of the Committee's recommendations and is already implementing some of them.</p><p>The key features of the Government's response are:</p><p><span class="bold">Undertaking a review of public bodies sponsored by central government</span></p><p>The Government agree with the Committee that the variety and complexity of public bodies supports the need for a review of their definition and scope.</p><p><span class="bold">Ensuring that information about Non Departmental Public Bodies is in the public domain</span></p><p>The Government support the need for details of public bodies within the remit of Central Government to be in the public domain.</p><p><span class="bold">The Commissioner for Public Appointments</span></p><p>The Government agree with the Committee that the Commissioner is central to the integrity and good practice of public appointments. The Government will examine the Public Appointments Order in Council to see whether it needs to be strengthened in order that the independence of the Commissioner is assured. It will also update the schedule to the Order providing a definitive list of appointments regulated by the Commissioner.

The Government recognise the value of having central teams in departments to advise on public appointments and work with sponsor teams. It also recognises that the NHS Appointments Commission is working well and some departments could benefit from using its services. The Government will be exploring this further.</p><p>Copies of the Government's response (Cm 6056) have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
