          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0412P0-04160">We announced in February 2002 that the British-based consortium Paradigm Secure Communications had been selected as preferred bidder to supply the SKYNET 5 satellite communications service to the MOD under the Private Finance Initiative.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04161">I am pleased to announce that last Friday contract negotiations were successfully concluded and that the SKYNET 5 PFI contract, the biggest yet placed by the MOD, has been enacted.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04162">The full value of the contract, which is planned to run until 2018, is expected to be around &#x00A3;2.5 billion and Paradigm expect it to create or sustain up to 1,900 jobs across the UK at its peak.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_10ws' title='Col. 10WS &mdash; HC Deb 28 October 2003 vol 412 c10WS' name='column_10ws' href='#column_10ws' rel='bookmark'>10WS</a><p id="S6CV0412P0-04163">The MOD is getting this service at a significant value for money advantage compared to the costs that would have been associated with a more traditional procurement route.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04164">The move to a PFI approach and accompanying fresh and innovative thinking has resulted in substantial savings. SKYNET 5 is within budget and remains on target to achieve initial provision of new services from 2005. It is a clear example of how we are getting better military capability and better value for money by using Smart Acquisition principles.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04165">This deal will provide the MOD with a number of benefits, including transfer to risk to the contractor. SKYNET 5 will also provide a greatly improved service with regular technology upgrades, and the flexibility to cope with the growth in military satellite communications requirements we expect over the next few years.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04166">The events of 11 September 2001 provided us all with a timely reminder to make sure that our key military communication and information systems have the necessary resilience to ensure business continuity. SKYNET 5 services will provide this assurance under almost any conceivable scenarios.</p>
