          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0412P0-04144">HQ 3 (UK) Division continues to command the multinational division (South-East) (MND(SE)) in Iraq, with contributions from the Czech Republic, Denmark, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal and Romania.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04145">We have begun a process of roulement of United Kingdom Forces, which involves the incremental replacement of HQ 3 (UK) Division with a composite HQ MND(SE), the replacement of 19 Mechanised Brigade with 20 Armoured Brigade the replacement of HQ 101 Logistic Brigade with a composite HQ UK National Support Element (NSE), the roulement of the combat service support units that will make up the UK NSE, and the mobilisation of around 1,000 reservists. We expect the maritime and air elements of our presence in theatre to remain broadly stable.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04146">A number of adjustments to our force levels in Iraq were made over the summer. Some of these were relatively minor, such as the withdrawal of around 30 armoured engineers and the short-term deployment of around 30 personnel from 23 Pioneer Regiment Royal Logistic Corps to undertake building and construction tasks around Shabah Logistics Base.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04147">On a larger scale, we also deployed the 2nd Battalion The Light Infantry (2LI) and the 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets (1RGJ), to conduct a number of additional security and training tasks and provide MND(SE) with the flexibility and capacity to carry out surge operations designed to counter crime and enhance security. A recent major operation in MND(SE), OPERATION SWEENEY, has resulted in 291 arrests, the seizure of six weapons caches, and the interception of 57 vessels and 58 vehicles involved in criminal activity.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04148">Some of the additional requirements for which 2LI and 1RGJ deployed are now being reduced or progressively transferred to Iraqi security forces. But some other requirements will continue over the next few months, including the provision of training for the new Iraqi Civil Defence Corps. In overall terms, we assess that these continuing requirements can be met by approximately one battalion rather than two. When 2LI and 1 RGJ are withdrawn from theatre in November and December they will therefore be replaced by the 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment (2 PARA). We envisage that 2 PARA will deploy from early November.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_8ws' title='Col. 8WS &mdash; HC Deb 28 October 2003 vol 412 c8WS' name='column_8ws' href='#column_8ws' rel='bookmark'>8WS</a><p id="S6CV0412P0-04149">In addition to adjustments to force levels, we have also deployed further equipment to theatre, including over 200 armoured Land Rovers, three Puma helicopters and three Gazelle helicopters. Taken together, these enhancements provide MND(SE) with greater mobility, force protection and surveillance capabilities, increasing the flexibility and effectiveness of the force.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04150">We will continue to keep the size and mix of forces in theatre under close review, and we expect to make further adjustments as a matter of routine to ensure that MND(SE) have appropriate capabilities for the tasks in hand. This is likely to include temporary increases in force levels when appropriate, to provide the General Officer Commanding MND(SE) with additional tactical flexibility and help ensure that progress and momentum are maintained and where possible accelerated. To facilitate this process we intend as a matter of course to nominate two battalions as over-the-horizon operational reserves for Iraq.</p>
