Adam Ingram MP concluded that none of the existing juvenile justice centres were suitable. On 29 November 2000 he announced that the best way forward was to construct a new purpose designed facility on land available at Rathgael and that while the new centre was being built, young people already in the system should be transferred to the Rathgael campus. He also announced that Lisnevin would close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of the Rathgael site is being advanced in two stages and I am pleased to announce in this statement that Phase 1, which involved the extensive renovation and up-grading of the Juvenile Justice centre on that site has now been completed and that the Lisnevin centre has closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The refurbished centre is now fully operational and will provide a step change in the quality of the custodial provision for juvenile offenders in Northern Ireland. It will operate as the sole custodial facility for young people in Northern Ireland, providing a satisfactory interim solution pending the construction of a purpose-built centre on the same site over the next 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Youth Justice Agency' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/oct/14/youth-justice-agency'></outline>

      <outline id='3605861' text="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs (Mr. David Lammy)&lt;p&gt;On 14 September 2003 a Transitional Provisions Order relating to the status of chancel repair liability was made under the Land Registration Act 2002. The making of the order follows the reversal by the House of Lords in June 2003 of the Court of Appeal's decision in Wallbank v Parochial Church Council of the Parish of Aston Cantlow and Wilmcote with Billesley, Warwickshire. The order provides that, for a period of 10 years from the coming into force of the Act on 13 October 2003, chancel repair liability will remain an interest that binds successive owners of land even though it is not protected by an entry in a register kept by the Land Registry. As no land registration fee is payable for applications to protect similar ancient property rights, such as payments in lieu of tithe, Crown rents and manorial rights, the Land Registry intends to waive the fee for applications to protect chancel repair liability for the 10 year period.&lt;/p&gt;" title='Land Registration Act 2002—Chancel Repair Liability' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/oct/14/land-registration-act-2002-chancel'></outline>

All those who were receiving Minimum Income Guarantee have now been transferred automatically onto Pension Credit. Of the awards made 1.15 million pensioner households (over 1.3 million pensioners) will get more than they would have before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our direct mail campaign is continuing, supported by a major advertising campaign on TV and in the press which began in September. We have now written to some 1.6 million households and will have written to all pensioner households by June 2004. We are continuing to work with partner organisations, such as Help The Aged, Age Concern and Citizens Advice, amongst others, both at a national and local level, to encourage eligible people to take up their entitlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have made good use of an advance application period, which began in April, to ensure that our systems and procedures are working as they should and we have recruited extra staff and invested in new infrastructure to meet the additional demands of the new entitlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of time for pensioners to apply for Pension Credit. To ensure that pensioners do not lose out, there is a twelve month backdating provision until October 2004. This will allow applications to be backdated to October 2003, where entitlement exists, or to the date entitlement begins if this is later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am placing a chart showing progress so far in the Library.

      <outline id='3605873' text='The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr. Jack Straw)&lt;p&gt;On 4 October the Prime Minister and I attended the opening session of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) in Rome. The Conference has been convened to enable member states to make decisions on a future Constitutional Treaty in order to ensure that an expanded European Union is both more effective and more accountable. Its starting point is the draft Treaty produced by the Convention on the Future of Europe, placed before the House this August as Command Paper 5897.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 9 September we issued a White Paper (Cm 5934) setting out the Government&apos;s approach towards the IGC. As we said in that White Paper, the draft Treaty is a good basis for starting the IGC negotiations. It consolidates existing Treaties into a clearer and more comprehensible text, but one which does not alter the fundamental constitutional relationship between the member States and the Union. It provides for the more efficient decision making processes which will be needed in an enlarged Union of 25 members. For example, it proposes a new position of full-time Chair of the European Council, which will make the Union more efficient, by ending the frequent changes of direction and priority inherent in the rotating Presidency system. It also reinforces the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, and the application of the principle of subsidiarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not regard the draft treaty as perfect: as for many other member sates, there are some points in the text which we want to change and others which we need to examine in more detail. Final decisions at the IGC are&#x000A;&lt;image src="S6CV0411P0I0631"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;7WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;by unanimity and, as our White Paper stated, we will only accept a final text which makes it clear that issues like tax, defence and foreign policy remain the province of the nation State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This first detailed session of the IGC, attended by Foreign Ministers, agreed that, when the Council of Ministers is legislating, its proceedings should be as open as possible. It also agreed that the provision in the draft Treaty for establishing a legislative Council, which we opposed, would be dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Council of 16 and 17 October will continue discussion of the draft Treaty. In the meantime Foreign Ministers met in the context of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, on 13 October. We hope for agreement on a final text in sufficient time to allow for signature of a treaty, as provided in the conclusions of the Thessaloniki Council, as soon as possible after 1 May 2004. In the interim we will of course continue to keep the House informed of progress, including through Ministerial appearances at the IGC Standing Committee.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Intergovernmental Conference (Rome)' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/oct/14/intergovernmental-conference-rome'></outline>

The Council regularly organises or sponsors exhibitions overseas of works of art loaned from National Galleries and private collections in the United Kingdom. It provides certain assurances or guarantees in respect of loss or damage while these works are on loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the six-month period ended 30 March 2003 the British Council provided such assurances to 4 national lenders and undertakings to 171 private lenders. The value of the contingent liabilities that remained outstanding as at 30 March 2003 in respect of national lenders was &amp;#x00A3;300,000 and &amp;#x00A3;3,703,862 in respect of private lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a recent review, HM Treasury, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the British Council have agreed to a revision of the Government art indemnities arrangements for artworks loaned to British Council exhibitions overseas. The revised scheme, which comes into effect on 1 April 2004, has three main features. The maximum total liability available to the Council at any one time will be &amp;#x00A3;50 million (compared with the current &amp;#x00A3;70 million). The &amp;#x00A3;50 million limit does not include "high value" exhibitions (i.e. single exhibitions valued at &amp;#x00A3;30 million or over), which are treated separately. In the case of "high value" exhibitions the Council will submit proposals to the UK&apos;s Public Diplomacy Strategy Board and HM Treasury for approval at least two years in advance. For all exhibitions the Council will have to show evidence of having approached the Government of the host country for cover and of having sought sponsorship for commercial insurance.&lt;/p&gt;' title='British Council Art Exhibitions' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/oct/14/british-council-art-exhibitions'></outline>

We expect to channel a substantial proportion of this spending through Multi-Donor Trust Fund arrangements being established by the World Bank and the United Nations, and to continue to support bilateral and multilateral programmes in Iraq. This funding does not include the costs of maintaining security in Iraq, towards which we are making a major contribution. Nor will it involve any reduction in DFID's planned development expenditure for low income countries. We remain committed to deliver &amp;#x00A3;1 billion of bilateral assistance for Africa in 2005&amp;#x2013;6, and to increase the proportion of bilateral spending on low income countries to 90 per cent. by the same time.&lt;/p&gt;" title='IRAQ: Reconstruction' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/oct/14/iraq-reconstruction'></outline>

It entails the Government agreeing that, when the restructuring takes place (Restructuring Effective Date), it will enter into the following principal agreements with British Energy:&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;&#x000A;CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT, which details the mechanisms by which the British Energy group will make contributions to the Nuclear Liabiities Fund (NLF) for the purpose of discharging its liabilities.&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;image src="S6CV0411P0I0633"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;11WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;NUCLEAR LIABILITIES FUNDING AGREEMENT, which provides for the mechanisms by which Government will meet its commitment to underwrite the NLF to the extent that British Energy&apos;s contributions are not sufficient to meet the costs, as and when they fall due, of decommissioning British Energy&apos;s power stations and discharging other uncontracted nuclear liabilities.&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;HISTORIC LIABILITIES FUNDING AGREEMENT, which details the mechanisms by which Government undertakes to discharge British Energy&apos;s payment obligations under certain of its existing contracts with BNFL with respect to the management, reprocessing and storage of historic spent fuel, i.e. fuel loaded into British Energy&apos;s reactors prior to the Restructuring Effective Date.&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;OPTION AGREEMENT, which details the mechanisms by which Government may exercise an option to acquire the British Energy stations at the time when British Energy plans to shut them, either to prolong their operation where it is economically advantageous to do so or decommission them within the public sector.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These agreements are within the terms of the support for British Energy which I announced to the House on 28 November last year. They are summarised in more detail in British Energy&apos;s announcement of 1 October, which I have placed in the Libraries of both Houses. This announcement also gives more details of the conditions of the formal agreements to the proposed restructuring, which include the acceptance of the restructuring terms by a sufficient number of British Energy&apos;s significant creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The restructuring will only be implemented once all these conditions are met. Other conditions include the receipt of State Aid approval from the European Commission. The Commission announced on 23 July 2003 that it was opening a formal investigation procedure into the Government&apos;s proposed restructuring aid to British Energy. The period for third party comments to the Commission has now closed and the Government are continuing to work with the Commission to complete the investigation as swiftly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if the Government are not satisfied that British Energy will be viable in all reasonably foreseeable conditions, or if there is a material adverse change in British Energy&apos;s position, the Government have reserved the right to withdraw their support for the restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would include withdrawal of the Government&apos;s secured credit facility, which the Government are otherwise continuing to make available to British Energy at its current level of up to &amp;#x00A3;200 million. Drawings under the credit facility can be made up to the date of the European Commission&apos;s decision on the Government&apos;s proposed restructuring aid, or 30 September 2004, whichever is earlier. Repayments under the credit facility have to be made by the earlier of the Restructuring Effective Date or 30 September 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British Energy&apos;s announcement is a significant step forward in the implementation of its restructuring plan. However, there are significant milestones ahead, and the Government&apos;s contingency plans to fund the administration of the company should any of the restructuring conditions not be met or the restructuring fail for any other reason, will, therefore, remain in place. This means that whether or not the solvent restructuring plan is implemented the nuclear power stations will&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;12WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;continue to generate electricity and employ staff and customers&apos; lights will stay on. Government&apos;s overriding objectives of ensuring the safety of the nuclear power stations and the security of electricity supplies to the grid and consumers will be met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand that in November British Energy will be making copies of the key agreements signed on 1 October available for public inspection. When this takes place, I will also place copies of those agreements in the Libraries of both Houses.&lt;/p&gt;' title='British Energy' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/oct/14/british-energy'></outline>

      <outline id='3605884' text='The Minister for Housing and Planning (Keith Hill)&lt;p&gt;I have today published for consultation draft regulations and policy statements on regional and local planning arrangements, and on development control processes. The regulations and guidance underpin the provisions of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill, currently before the House. They are issued for consultation, subject of course to any changes made to the Bill by the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draft regulations set out detailed procedural matters in relation to regional and local planning matters and development control. We are also publishing draft revised rules for procedures for major infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning Policy Statement 11 (PPS11), which will supersede PPG11 when the Planning Bill comes into effect, sets out the how Regional Spatial Strategies (RSS) should be prepared and revised under the new statutory framework. In particular it places a new emphasis on community involvement and partnership working, integration with other strategies, making the RSS more regionally specific and on the delivery of policies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning Policy Statement 12 (PPS12) sets out the Government&apos;s policy on the preparation of the local development documents that will comprise the local development framework for a local planning authority or for a minerals and waste planning authority. It explains the actions that need to be taken in preparing the local development documents, which will deliver the spatial strategy for the area and the new, streamlined arrangements for dealing with the formal stages of the process. It emphasises the need for community involvement and explains how local planning authorities should prepare sound development plan documents, which will be independently tested before adoption by the authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government also published today for consultation draft guidance on development control matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S6CV0411P0I0634"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;13WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will be publishing consultation drafts of other planning policy statements in due course, in particular Planning Policy Statement 1, setting out the principles underlying the planning system in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public consultation on the draft guidance and regulations will run until 16 January. The secondary legislation will be laid before Parliament as soon as&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;14WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;possible after the Planning Bill receives Royal Assent. We are planning for both the guidance and secondary legislation to come into effect at commencement of the Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am today placing copies of the documents in the House library. They will also be available on the website of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/oct/14/planning-and-compulsory-purchase-bill'></outline>
