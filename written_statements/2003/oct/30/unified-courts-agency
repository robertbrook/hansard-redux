          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0412P0-04234">The Secretary of State and I have carefully considered all the representations made to us about the location of Hampshire and the Isle of Wight within the structure of the new courts agency. We have focused on what produces the best justice system for the public in the South East and South West regions. A number of submissions have been made to us on the administration of justice if Hampshire were to be part of the South East region. We acknowledge that making a change at this stage would raise a number of potentially difficult issues for the Judiciary and the Bar, which could impact on the administration of justice for the public. In addition we have received representations from partner criminal justice agencies locally to the effect that from their perspective change would not bring significant benefit.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04235">The established Government policy of aligning public bodies with the Government regions is important and can potentially bring significant benefits to the administration of justice. However the immediate benefits of that policy do not, currently, justify realigning Hampshire and the Isle of Wight in the South East region. Taking account of the widespread strength of feeling, we have decided not to realign Hampshire and the Isle of Wight at this time. As the regional agenda develops, however, we believe there may well be a much clearer case for realignment and we will therefore reconsider this issue in 2006&#x2013;07.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04236">In reviewing the distribution of business across Hampshire, Dorset and Wiltshire, we have decided that in order to provide a better service for court users in Dorset that subject to the views of the senior judiciary Bournemouth Crown Court should become a first tier centre. This would mean that serious cases from Dorset could be tried more conveniently&#x2014;clearly a benefit for victims and witnesses in the area.</p>
