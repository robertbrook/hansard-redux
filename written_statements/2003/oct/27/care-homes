          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0412P0-05144">There are a variety of reasons for the overall reduction in the number of care home places since 1998.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-05145">The decline since 1998 is a continuation of a trend that began in the mid 90s with the implementation of the <a href="/acts/nhs-and-community-care-act-1990">NHS and Community Care Act 1990</a>. Since then the care home market has been contracting. This trend has been reinforced by increased support for alternative models of care, such as intensive home care packages, introduced since 1997. Local councils are responsible for the commissioning of a range of care options that are made available for older and disabled people, and the availability of care home places, therefore, is a matter for local councils to determine.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-05146">The Government believe that people should be given a real choice of care options as far as possible in each locality. While the number of available care home places has decreased since 1998, in the same period there have been 20,900 more households receiving intensive home care, a 34 per cent. increase. Additionally, we are investing in extra care housing in order to offer people greater choice in the future.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-05147">Finally, the number of people aged 75 and over delayed awaiting discharge from hospital has reduced from 6,219 in September 1998 to 4,147 in September 2002 and 3,151 in June 2003. The downward trend should continue with the implementation of the Community Care (Delayed Discharges etc) Act (2003).</p>
