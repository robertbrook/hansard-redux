          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0412P0-04621">Since the late 1980s, the UK has played a full and active role in the development of EU policy on genetically modified organisms (GMOs), including GM crops. This has resulted in a strong, transparent and accountable regulatory framework, including the adoption in 2001 of an enhanced generic Directive (<cite class="reference"><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aeuropa.eu+2001%2F18%2FEC" rel="ref">2001/18/EC</a></cite>) on the safety assessment of GMOs and in 2003 of specific measures on the traceability and labelling of GMOs, on genetically modified food and feed, and on exports of GMOs from the Community. Throughout, we have argued for an approach which is precautionary, evidence-based and proportionate, and which takes due account of international obligations under agreements such as the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. The Government has also paid particular attention to the practical aspects of implementation, with the UK, for example, being one of only four member states so far to have completed implementation of Directive <cite class="reference"><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aeuropa.eu+2001%2F18%2FEC" rel="ref">2001/18/EC</a></cite>.</p>

No GM crops can be sown without further regulatory approval which cannot take place until next spring at the earliest. We expect to receive ACRE'S advice in December or early January.</p>
