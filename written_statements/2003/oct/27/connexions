          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0412P0-05014">All partnerships will be inspected by Ofsted on a four-yearly cycle and are required to conduct an annual self-assessment of performance based on the Ofsted inspection framework. One question in the Ofsted inspection framework focuses on the responsiveness of the Partnership to the range and diversity of young people in the area. It addresses whether the partnership has effective strategies to enable all young people to gain access to support and provision responsive to their needs. Government Offices also assess this aspect by monitoring partnerships' self-assessment. Of the 12 inspection reports so far published, eight partnerships have been rated overall as good or very good.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-05015">An independent survey of 16,000 young people comprising those with all types of need who had been in contact with Connexion services showed minimal differences in awareness of or ability to access the service. Only 12 per cent. of those requiring least intensive support disagreed with the statement, "It is easy to get hold of people at Connexions when you need to", compared with 11 per cent. of those requiring more intensive support and 13 per cent. of those requiring most intensive support. 87 per cent. of those requiring least intensive support agreed that: "Connexions helps me to see all the options available to me".</p>
