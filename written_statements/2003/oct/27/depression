Doctors are able to legally prescribe medicines outside their licensed indications if they consider it is in the best interests of their patient.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-05178">On the basis of advice from their independent expert working group on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) has issued advice that paroxetine (Seroxat) and venlafaxine (Efexor) should not be used in the treatment of depression in children and adolescents under 18 years. This followed review of clinical trial data which suggested an increased risk of self harm and potentially suicidal behaviour in those treated with paroxetine or venlafaxine, compared with those given placebo.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-05179">The safety and efficacy of other SSRIs in children and adolescents is under review by the expert working group. The working group is also providing input to the Europe-wide consideration of the safety of paroxetine, which is being led by the Netherlands and the UK on behalf of the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-05180">As part of the review of the safety of SSRIs, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has commissioned a study using general practitioner records to investigate whether there is an association between the consumption of antidepressants, including SSRIs, and suicide. This study includes children and adolescents. Interim guidance has been provided to all doctors and pharmacists in the CSM's bulletin. "Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance." The National Institute of Clinical Excellence is in the process of drafting guidelines on the treatment of depression in children and adolescents.</p>

The guideline will provide recommendations for good practice that are based on the best available evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-05183">The Department has also commissioned the "Mind Out of Mental Health" campaign to work with its partners in the voluntary sector, the media, employers and youth student organisations to raise awareness of mental health problems, as well as combating the stigma and sidcrimination surrounding mental health. They provide advice and information on a range of mental health problems including depression. The "Wired for Health website at <a class='resolved-url' href="http://www.wiredforhealth.gov.uk/">www.wiredforhealth.gov.uk/</a> is another useful source of information.</p>
