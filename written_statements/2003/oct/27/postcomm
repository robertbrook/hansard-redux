          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0412P0-04529">The <a href="/acts/postal-services-act-2000">Postal Services Act 2000</a> establishes the framework under which the Postal Services Commission may impose financial penalties. It is for the Commission to decide on its policy within this framework, which was adopted in February 2002 following a public consultation. I consequently have no plans to commission research in this area. The Commission frequently liases with other industry regulators in the UK, as well as postal regulators in the rest of Europe on a range of postal regulation matters. The recent decision to impose a financial penalty on Royal Mail is a matter for the Commission and is still under a 28 day period for comment. Such financial penalties are payable to Postcomm in the first instance, and then transferred to the Treasury Consolidated Fund.</p>

In accordance with section 43(2) of the Act the Secretary of State provided social and environmental guidance to the Commission on 22 March 2001.</p>
