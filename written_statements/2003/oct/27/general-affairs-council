          <q>Conclusions on Wider Europe, Iraq, Iran, and Western Balkans were agreed by consensus.</q></p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04819"><span class="italic">General Affairs Session</span></p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04820"><span class="italic">Progress of work in other council configurations</span>
          <q>The Presidency gave a standard progress report on work in other Councils (Agriculture, Finance and JHA).</q></p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04821"><span class="italic">Preparation of European Council (Brussels, 16&#x2013;17 October)</span>
          <q>This was a final discussion to confirm the annotated agenda for the European Council, the focus of which was on boosting growth. The agenda had already been agreed at the 29 September GAERC:</q>

          <li> External relations</li></ul></p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_57ws' title='Col. 57WS &mdash; HC Deb 27 October 2003 vol 412 c57WS' name='column_57ws' href='#column_57ws' rel='bookmark'>57WS</a><p id="S6CV0412P0-04822"><span class="italic">MEP Statutes</span>
          <q>Discussion centred on a letter from the President of the European Parliament on privileges and immunities.

          <q>Enlargement Commissioner Verheugen briefed on the progress on the Wider Europe/New Neighbourhood initiative endorsed by the Thessaloniki European Council in May 2003. Action Plans are to be developed for Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan, and Israel.

          <q>Short Conclusions on the Iran nuclear situation were agreed without substantive discussion. Conclusions on Iran human rights were also agreed. These reaffirmed the Union's commitment to the human rights dialogue with Iran, the last round of which took place on 8&#x2013;9 October 2003, as one of the means by which the EU can work to improve the human rights situation in the country. But Conclusions also stated that this dialogue was without prejudice to the possibility of promoting or co-sponsoring a Resolution at an UNGA session.</q></p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04827"><span class="italic">Iraq</span>
          <q>The Council confirmed the indicative Commission pledge of 200m Euro for the 23&#x2013;24 October Madrid Donors' Conference subject to budgetary process. Partners emphasised the importance of Madrid. The Commission indicated that this should not be seen as a standard donors' conference but more as an opportunity to agree on a multi-lateral framework for Iraqi reconstruction. The Presidency noted that aid and security improvements should be pushed forward in parallel.</q></p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04828"><span class="italic">Western Balkans</span>
          <q>ICTY Chief Prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, made a presentation on co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal in Yugoslavia, based on 9 October statement made to the UN Security Council.

Conclusions were also agreed on the launch of the Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue.</q></p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04829"><span class="italic">EU-Russia</span>
          <q>There was a brief discussion of relations with Russia in the context of the forthcoming EU-Russia summit. The Council also took note of Trade Commissioner Lamy's briefing on his discussions with Russia on their WTO accession. Commissioner Lamy said that he would be returning to Moscow on 15 October to try to move some of these issues forward. There was no substantive discussion.</q></p>
