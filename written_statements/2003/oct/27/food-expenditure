          75 per cent. of fresh produce, by quantity, is of UK origin. It is not possible to provide a similar estimate for food provided for official hospitality and working lunches due to the large number of suppliers involved.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04941">DEFRA are currently working with DWP private sector partners and canteen catering service providers to raise awareness of sustainable purchasing practices and to highlight local sourcing issues. We are also working with our partners to develop an action plan to implement the Sustainable Food Procurement initiative recently introduced by DEFRA.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04942">
