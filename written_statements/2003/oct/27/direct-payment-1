It is for customers to decide which account best meets their needs and circumstances. 87 per cent. of benefit customers and 90 per cent. of pensioners already have access to a bank account. The move to Direct Payment will give people more choice about where and when they collect their money&#x2014;including from the Post Office.</p><p id="S6CV0412P0-04917">Officials have had a number of discussions with the British Bankers' Association about the move to Direct Payment of benefits and pensions. The features of individual accounts (including charges and overdraft facilities) are a matter for the account provider. There is a wide range of accounts available which are free to operate and do not offer overdraft facilities. Some account providers do charge their customers if there is not enough money in their account to cover direct debits. Account providers make their customers aware of these charges and leaflets provided to benefits customers and pensioners also set out the possibility of charges in these circumstances.</p>

          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0412P0-04923">The order book system is outdated, inefficient, open to fraud and abuse, and costly to administer. It needs to be modernised to keep in step with changing customer needs and to reflect the fact that most people now have and use a bank account. Already 87 per cent. of all customers and over 90 per cent. of pensioners have access to an account that can receive Direct Payment.

Payment outlets for this exceptions method of payment will include Post Office branches. We expect this service will be in place from October 2004.</p>
