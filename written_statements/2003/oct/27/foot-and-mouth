          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0412P0-04615">Under the <a href="/acts/animal-health-act-1981">Animal Health Act 1981</a>, the compensation payable for animals slaughtered for disease control purposes is taken to mean their market value immediately before they were slaughtered or affected. A valuer appointed by Defra makes an assessment to determine a figure that represents the market value, and in the normal course, this is the amount of compensation Defra would pay. In a few cases during 2001, where it was apparent that the valuation and/or the figure was incorrect or flawed in some material way, Defra made an adjustment to ensure that the compensation paid to the owner properly represented the value of the slaughtered animals within the meaning of the legislation. Information on the number of cases where this occurred can be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
