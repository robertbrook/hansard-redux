          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0412P0-05094">We are making good progress in setting up Sector Skills Councils (SSCs). I expect the network of around 25 SSCs will be in place by summer 2004, as outlined in the recently published White Paper, `21st Century Skills. Realising Our Potential.' Between April and October this year, four SSCs have been awarded full five year licenses to operate. They are e-skills UK covering I T, Telecommunications and Contact Centres; SEMTA covering Science, Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies; ConstructionSkills covering Construction and Skills Active UK covering Active Leisure and Learning. A total of nine are expected to be licensed by o.he end of this year. Plans are well advanced to licence a further 16 SSCs including the five trailblazer SSCs by summer 2004.</p>

          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0412P0-05096">There are currently four SSCs that have been awarded full five year licences to operate. Together they cover approximately 20 per cent. of the UK workforce. It is expected that the full network of around 25 Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) will be in place by Summer 2004 as outlined in the recently published White Paper, '21st Century Skills. Realising Our Potential'. This will provide a total coverage of up to 75 per cent. of the workforce. This is expected to rise to 85 per cent. over the next three years as the SSDA continues to work with other sectors to put in place suitable arrangements for engagement with the Skills for Business Network.</p>

The former Employment National Training Organisation (ENTO) currently has stewardship of occupational standards for advice and guidance. No formal decisions have yet been taken on which SSC will represent careers advice and guidance employer interests in the Skills for Business Network.</p>
