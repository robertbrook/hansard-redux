      <outline id='3559681' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. Tony McNulty)&lt;p id="S6CV0412P0-04237"&gt;The Government today published a consultation paper on its proposals to amend the rail provisions in Part V of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA). The consultation period will end on Monday 26 January 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0412P0-04238"&gt;Amending the rail provisions of the DDA was one of the recommendations made by the Disability Rights Task Force (DRTF) in their report "From Exclusion to Inclusion". The Government have accepted the DRTF&apos;s recommendations on transport. This consultation process fulfils the commitment to take forward the recommendations for the introduction of an end date by which all rail vehicles must comply with the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 1998 and regulations covering the refurbishment of rail vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0412P0-04239"&gt;The consultation also takes the opportunity to invite views on a number of associated issues that affect the operation of the rail provisions of the Act. These additional issues, which include changes to the enforcement regime and the removal of the requirement for exemptions to be granted via statutory instrument, were not covered in the DRTF report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0412P0-04240"&gt;As rail services are not devolved, this consultation will cover England, Scotland and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0412P0-04241"&gt;Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Disability Discrimination Act (Rail Provisions)' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/nov/03/disability-discrimination-act-rail'></outline>

      <outline id='3559695' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Mr. Chris Pond)&lt;p id="S6CV0412P0-04242"&gt;Deductions from eligible rent for heating and hot water were not increased in the 2003 uprating Order (S.I. 2003/526) from &amp;#x00A3;1.15 to &amp;#x00A3;1.20 as was indicated in the statement made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, Mr. Andrew Smith, on 18 November 2002,&lt;i&gt;Official Report&lt;/i&gt;, column 365. Eligible rent forms part of local authorities assessment of Housing Benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0412P0-04243"&gt;The annual DWP uprating circular quoted a deduction rate of &amp;#x00A3;1.20, which means that some housing benefit recipients will have been underpaid. Local authorities are being advised today of the issue and are being advised to take corrective action on affected cases, and that they should consider how best to take that action given their individual circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Housing Benefit' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/nov/03/housing-benefit'></outline>

Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and I will be launching an information campaign in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber on 3 and 4 November. This campaign will explain to voters the issues around the referendums on regional assemblies and the associated local government changes, which we expect to be held next autumn.

      <outline id='3559701' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Fiona Mactaggart)&lt;p id="S6CV0412P0-04245"&gt;I am pleased to announce that the Government and the voluntary and community sector will be celebrating the fifth birthday of the Compact on Relations between Government and the sector with Compact Week from 3 to 9 November. The Compact is the partnership agreement for improving our relationship. Since the Compact was launched in 1998, this has been followed by five Codes of Good Practice (on consultation, funding, black and minority ethnic organisations, volunteering and community groups), and Local Compact Guidelines. Progress is being achieved across Government and the Sector in implementing the Compact and Codes. We have been working with Local Government and the majority of local authority areas are now covered by a Local Compact, also involving other local public sector bodies, for building on relationships at local level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0412P0-04246"&gt;We need to build further on the achievements to date by continuing to promote the Compact and good working practice between Government and the sector, and the sector&apos;s activity. Compact Week is an excellent opportunity to take steps to encourage greater awareness and make the Compact a reality across the breadth of Government and the voluntary and community sector.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Voluntary and Community Sector' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/nov/03/voluntary-and-community-sector'></outline>

      <outline id='3559704' text='The Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn)&lt;p id="S6CV0412P0-04247"&gt;I represented the United Kingdom at the Donors&apos; Conference on Iraq held in Madrid on 23 and 24 October. My right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and Baroness Symons also attended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0412P0-04248"&gt;The Conference was opened by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. A total of 73 countries attended, along with 20 international organisations and 13 non-governmental organisations. The Iraqi Governing Council was represented by their President, Dr. Ayad Allawi, and a number of other members. Iraqi Ministers also participated. The Conference was characterised by a strong and visible Iraq presence, as well as by a sense&#x000A;&lt;image src="S6CV0412P0I0714"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;25WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;of the international community coming together to focus on how it can help Iraqis secure a stable and prosperous future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0412P0-04249"&gt;Over US&amp;#x0024;33 billion in grants and concessional loans was pledged towards Iraq&apos;s reconstruction for the period 2004 to 2007, significantly exceeding expectations. &amp;#x0024;20 billion was pledged by the USA, &amp;#x0024;5 billion by Japan, &amp;#x0024;3 billion-&amp;#x0024;5 billion by the World Bank, &amp;#x0024;2.5 billion by the IMF, and the rest by other bilateral donors, mainly from European and Arab countries. Additional pledges were made by way of export credits and assistance in kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0412P0-04250"&gt;In addition to the finance committed at Madrid, Iraq&apos;s investment needs are expected to be met increasingly by oil revenues, foreign direct investment&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;26WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;and commercial lending once Iraq&apos;s debts have been rescheduled through the Paris Club. Another donor meeting could be called in the future if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0412P0-04251"&gt;As set out in my statement to the House on 14 October, I pledged &amp;#x00A3;296 million over the next two years on behalf of the United Kingdom, bringing our total commitment in Iraq since April 2003 to &amp;#x00A3;544m. This commitment will not result in any reduction in DFID&apos;s planned development expenditure for low income countries, or affect our commitment of &amp;#x00A3;1bn for Africa by 2005&amp;#x2013;06. Nor will it result in any reductions to existing programme commitments in the current financial year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0412P0-04252"&gt;The Conference Chair&apos;s Conclusions can be found on the Conference website: &lt;u&gt;http:// www.comisionadoiraq.org/donors/index_ing.htm&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0412P0-04253"&gt;My speech to the Conference is on DFID&apos;s website: &lt;u&gt;http://www.dfid.gov.uk/&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;' title="Iraq (Madrid Donors' Conference)" type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2003/nov/03/iraq-madrid-donors-conference'></outline>
