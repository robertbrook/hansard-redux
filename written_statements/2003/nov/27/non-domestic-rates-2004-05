          </p><p>The above calculation involves estimating several figures that are inherently difficult to forecast accurately, such as the gross rate yield and the prior year adjustments. The resulting figure of &#x00A3;15.014 billion has therefore been rounded to &#x00A3;15 billion exactly to avoid spurious accuracy.</p><p><span class="italic">Notes:</span></p><p>For 2001&#x2013;02 and 2002&#x2013;03 the amounts shown are those recorded in the outturn (NNDR3) returns. For 2003&#x2013;04 the amounts shown are the provisional outturn for the year based mainly upon authorities' provisional contributions to the non-domestic rating pool. For 2004&#x2013;05 the estimates are based on:
          <ol class="hide_numbering">
          <li>1. Item 1: The gross calculated rate yield represents the total value of non-domestic hereditaments on local rating lists <i>adjusted in relation to previous years outturn information regarding the gross rate yield</i> times the multiplier.</li>
          <li>2. Item 1(i)(a): The transitional decrease adjustment includes the estimated amount of rates that will not be recouped from local list ratepayers under the transitional arrangements made by egulations under section 58 of the <a href="/acts/local-government-finance-act-1988">Local Government Finance Act 1988</a> and the transitional relief scheme, announced by written PQ on 25 November 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column 770W.</li>
          <li>3. Item 1(i)(b): The empty property relief adjustments include voids and partially occupied hereditaments. The 2004&#x2013;05 figure includes an allowance for the increase in the gross rate yield.</li>
          <li>4. Item 1(i)(c): Charitable rate relief. The 2004&#x2013;05 figure includes an allowance for the increase in the gross rate yield.</li>
          <li>5. Item 1(i)(d): Rural Shops and Post Office relief. Figures include mandatory relief for general stores and post offices under the <a href="/acts/local-government-and-rating-act-1997">Local Government and Rating Act 1997</a>. Figures for 2001&#x2013;02 onwards includes mandatory relief for petrol filing stations and public houses under the Non-Domestic Rating (Public Houses and Petrol Filling Stations) (England) Order 2001 (SI 2001/1345) and mandatory relief for new enterprises on former agricultural premises under the <a href="/acts/rating-former-agricultural-premises-and-rural-shops-act-2001">Rating (Former Agricultural Premises and Rural Shops) Act 2001</a>. The 2004&#x2013;05 figure includes an allowance for the increase in the gross rate yield.</li>
          <li>6. Item 1(i)(e): Community Amateur Sports Clubs (CASCs). Mandatory rate relief for sports clubs registered with the Inland Revenue as Community Amateur Sports Clubs under the Section 64 of the <a href="/acts/local-government-act-2003">Local Government Act 2003</a>. This provision comes into effect on 1 April 2004. Sports Clubs that have not registered will still be eligible for discretionary relief allowed to non-profit making bodies.</li>
          <li>7. Item 1(i)(f): Discretionary relief granted to charities, non-profit making organisations and for other reasons including discretionary relief for village shops and post offices under the <a href="/acts/local-government-and-rating-act-1997">Local Government and Rating Act 1997</a>. Figures for 2001&#x2013;02 onwards include discretionary relief for petrol filing stations and public houses under the Non-Domestic Rating (Public Houses and Petrol Filling Stations) (England) Order 2001 (SI 2001/1345) and discretionary relief for new enterprises on former agricultural premises under the <a href="/acts/rating-former-agricultural-premises-and-rural-shops-act-2001">Rating (Former Agricultural Premises and Rural Shops) Act 2001</a>. The 2004&#x2013;05 figure includes an allowance for the increase in the gross rate yield.</li>
