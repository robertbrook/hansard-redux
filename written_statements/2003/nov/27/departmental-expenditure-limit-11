During the planning stage, an alternative simpler solution was identified and tested and it is this initiative that will be taken forward by Criminal Justice Information Technology (CJIT). CJIT have indicated that they do not require the funding to be transferred and consequently the decrease in the capital element of the DEL arises from the CPS returning &#x00A3;1,800,000 capital to the Capital Modernisation Fund.</p><p>The Serious Fraud Office's (SFO) DEL will increase by &#x00A3;5,440,000 from &#x00A3;23,410,000 to &#x00A3;28,850,000 and the Administration Costs Limit will increase by &#x00A3;2,240,000 from &#x00A3;16,235,000 to &#x00A3;18,475,000.</p><p>The increase in the resource element of the DEL arises from additional costs relating to two blockbuster fraud cases; &#x00A3;2,240,000 relates to increased administration costs and &#x00A3;3,200,000 relates to programme costs&#x2014; mainly investigation and prosecution costs.</p><p>The change in the capital element of the SFO DEL arises from a &#x00A3;450,000 increase in I.T. hardware spending, which relates to one of the blockbuster cases. These changes in DEL are supported by a claim on the DEL Reserve. This was agreed due to these cases being considered different from normal SFO cases in terms of their size and complexity and because of the strong public interest in pursuing them.</p><p>There is no change in the resource element of the DEL for the Treasury Solicitors' Department (TSOL). The increase in capital of &#x00A3;2,050,000 from &#x00A3;3,200,000 to &#x00A3;5,250,000 arises from major areas of capital

          expenditure relating to the implementation of new systems and the upgrading of the Department's I.T. infrastructure. The new major systems include a practice and case management system, (which enables the Department to more effectively manage and monitor its casework), a new electronic records and electronic document management system and, also, an upgrade to the Department's financial systems.</p><p>There is no increase in the TSOL's administration cost limit.</p>
