          <p class="first-para">I have today published the major sections of the draft <a href="/bills/gambling-bill">Gambling Bill</a> for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p><p>The Bill will make major changes to the way in which gambling is regulated and controlled in Great Britain. It will build on the work undertaken by Sir Alan Budd and the Gambling Review Body that he led.</p><p>It is based on the three key principles:</p><p>First, the principle that the system of gambling law and regulation must keep the gambling industry free of crime. Our industry has a high international reputation for integrity, which must not be put at risk;</p><p>Second, the law must ensure that gambling is conducted fairly, so that players know what to expect; and</p><p>Third, there must be effective protection for children and the vulnerable.</p><p>The current laws on gambling dating back to the 1960s have failed to keep pace with rapid technological change. Attitudes to gambling have changed too. The law needs to be modernised but we must make sure that it is flexible enough to cope with further change.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_37ws' title='Col. 37WS &mdash; HC Deb 19 November 2003 vol 413 c37WS' name='column_37ws' href='#column_37ws' rel='bookmark'>37WS</a><p>However, modernisation does not mean a gambling free for all and reform must not be allowed to generate an upsurge in problem gambling. The provisions published today combine a managed relaxation of outdated restrictions with the strongest protections for children and the vulnerable. Following reform, there will be greater choice for adults but there will remain important limitations on what types of gambling are available and where they can be located.</p><p>INVESTOR IN PEOPLE</p><p>In A Safe Bet for Success (published in March 2002, Cm 5397) we accepted the vast majority of the Gambling Review's recommendations. Since then, we have been working closely with the interested industries, representatives of groups encouraging responsible gambling, local authorities, consumer groups, other Government Departments and the devolved administrations to prepare draft legislation that would give effect to this new system of regulation.</p><p>The proposals published today build on and subsume the draft clauses published in July 2003. They will simplify regulation by establishing a single regulator for commercial gambling. The Gambling Commission will have wider functions, greater flexibility to act and stronger enforcement powers than the Gaming board that it will replace. Local authorities will license all types of gambling premises, to ensure that local people have a say in where gambling outlets are sited. The draft Bill will keep crime out of gambling and protect the industry's reputation for integrity and excellence. The Gambling Commission will be a strong, effective regulator and will root out illegal gambling; its staff will have statutory powers of entry, search and seizure.</p><p>The draft Bill also removes unnecessary restrictions on the ability of business to meet consumers' wishes. The rule allowing casinos to be established only in designated parts of the country will be abolished, as will the rule requiring membership of a casino or bingo club at least 24 hours before playing. Remote gambling, for example on the Internet, interactive TV and through mobile telephones, will be licensed and regulated effectively in Great Britain for the first time.</p><p>The published clauses also strengthen safeguards protecting children and the vulnerable. The current minimum age limits for access to gambling products will be retained and enforced strongly. The draft Bill also includes reserve powers for a statutory levy on gambling operators. These powers will be used if the gambling industry does not keep its promises to contribute to a charitable trust funding research, prevention and treatment programmes for problem gambling.</p><p>A Joint Committee of both Houses has been convened to examine the Government's draft proposals. I am confident that what they will scrutinise is a set of mature proposals that will achieve a sensible reform of the law on gambling. Such scrutiny will improve the legislation and build parliamentary understanding and public confidence, enabling us to strike the right balance between deregulation and the protection of young and vulnerable people.</p><p>I intend to publish the remaining sections of the draft Bill early next year.</p>
