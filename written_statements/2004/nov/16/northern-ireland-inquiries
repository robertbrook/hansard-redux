          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0666P0-09834">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0666P0-09835">On 1 April this year, I published Justice Cory's reports into allegations of state collusion in four murders in Northern Ireland. In doing so, I confirmed my intention to establish inquiries into the deaths of Robert Hamill, Billy Wright and Rosemary Nelson.</p><p id="S5LV0666P0-09836">I am pleased to be able to confirm today both the identities of the inquiry panels and the inquiries' terms of reference.</p><p id="S5LV0666P0-09837">In each case, the panels will be chaired by a judge and will include both a member with specialist expertise and a lay member. The terms of reference have been deliberately drawn to allow the inquiries to consider both the allegations of collusion that have been made in these cases and the issue of possible negligence.</p><p id="S5LV0666P0-09838">The Robert Hamill inquiry will be chaired by Sir Edwin Jowitt, a retired member of the High Court of England and Wales. He will be joined on the inquiry panel by Sir John Evans (former Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall) and Reverend Baroness (Kathleen) Richardson of Calow (former Moderator of the Free Churches' Council of England and Wales). The inquiry will be held under Section 44 of the <a href="/acts/police-northern-ireland-act-1998">Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998</a>. Its terms of reference will be:
          <q>To inquire into the death of Robert Hamill with a view to determining whether any wrongful act or omission by or within the Royal Ulster Constabulary facilitated his death or obstructed the investigation of it, or whether attempts were made to do so; whether any such act or omission was intentional or negligent; whether the investigation of his death was carried out with due diligence; and to make recommendations.</q></p><p id="S5LV0666P0-09839">The Billy Wright inquiry will be chaired by the right honourable Lord (Ranald) MacLean of the Court of Session in Scotland. He will be supported in this role by Professor Andrew Coyle (Director of the International Centre for Prisons Studies at King's College, London) and the Right Reverend John Oliver (retired diocesan Bishop of Hereford). The inquiry will be held under Section 7 of the <a href="/acts/prison-act-1952">Prison Act</a> (Northern Ireland) 1953. Its terms of reference will be:
          <q>To inquire into the death of Billy Wright with a view to determining whether any wrongful act or omission by or within the prison authorities or other state agencies facilitated his death, or whether attempts were made to do so; whether any such act or omission was intentional or negligent; and to make recommendations.</q></p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_50ws' title='Col. 50WS &mdash; HL Deb 16 November 2004 vol 666 c50WS' name='column_50ws' href='#column_50ws' rel='bookmark'>50WS</a><p id="S5LV0666P0-09840">The Rosemary Nelson inquiry will be chaired by Sir Michael Morland, a retired member of the High Court of England and Wales. The other panel members will be Sir Anthony Burden (former Chief Constable of South Wales Police) and Dame Valerie Strachan (Vice Chair of the Big Lottery Fund and former Chairman of the Board of Customs and Excise). The inquiry will be held under Section 44 of the <a href="/acts/police-northern-ireland-act-1998">Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998</a>. Its terms of reference will be:
          <q>To inquire into the death of Rosemary Nelson with a view to determining whether any wrongful act or omission by or within the Royal Ulster Constabulary or Northern Ireland Office facilitated her death or obstructed the investigation of it, or whether attempts were made to do so; whether any such act or omission was intentional or negligent; whether the investigation of her death was carried out with due diligence; and to make recommendations.</q></p><p id="S5LV0666P0-09841">As I said in my Statement of 8 July, all three inquiries will have full powers to compel disclosure of documents and attendance of witnesses.</p><p id="S5LV0666P0-09842">The inquiries will start work as soon as possible.</p>
