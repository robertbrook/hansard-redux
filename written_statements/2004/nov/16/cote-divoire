          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0666P0-09880">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Geoffrey Hoon) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0666P0-09881">In a Statement on 11 November 2004, I outlined the military planning that was in hand to support an evacuation of UK nationals from C&#x00F4;te d'Ivoire.</p><p id="S5LV0666P0-09882">The deteriorating security conditions in C&#x00F4;te d'Ivoire last week subsequently led to an evacuation of UK nationals from the country, following a recommendation by Her Majesty's Ambassador to C&#x00F4;te d'Ivoire that he judged this a prudent course of action. This recommendation was formulated after receiving technical military advice from the operational liaison and reconnaissance team, which had deployed on 10 November 2004 to monitor the situation in the region as part of the Ministry of Defence's contingency planning.</p><p id="S5LV0666P0-09883">The spearhead lead element was initially deployed to a forward mounting base in Accra, Ghana, where the operation was commanded by elements of the UK's Joint Task Force Headquarters. The majority of these forces were drawn from the spearhead lead element based on the 1st Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, but the operation was supported and enabled by Royal Air Force transport aircraft from RAF Brize Norton and RAF Lyneham. As an additional contingency measure, the Landing Platform Dock HMS "Albion" was also diverted towards C&#x00F4;te d'Ivoire.</p><p id="S5LV0666P0-09884">It is indicative of the Armed Forces' capacity to undertake comprehensive contingency planning, and their flexibility and capability to respond quickly to events, that within 24 hours of receiving a formal request from the Foreign Secretary nearly 300 service personnel were on the ground in Ghana, engaged in preparations for the evacuation.</p><p id="S5LV0666P0-09885">Between 11 and 13 November 2004, UK forces evacuated some 220 individuals from Abidjan and Yamoussoukro to Ghana, where the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had set up a reception centre to cater for the men, women and children who wished to leave C&#x00F4;te d'Ivoire.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_58ws' title='Col. 58WS &mdash; HL Deb 16 November 2004 vol 666 c58WS' name='column_58ws' href='#column_58ws' rel='bookmark'>58WS</a><p id="S5LV0666P0-09886">All service personnel involved in the evacuation operation have now returned to the UK, with the exception of HMS "Albion" which has returned to normal duties.</p><p id="S5LV0666P0-09887">The success of this operation is in no small part due to the high degree of co-operation that existed between the deployed forces, Her Majesty's Ambassador and his staff in country, and with international partners in the region, in particular Ghana and France.</p><p id="S5LV0666P0-09888">The successful completion and efficient recovery of our deployed forces is an impressive achievement and one which took place without impact on the UK's enduring commitments across the globe. This is testament to the professionalism of the men and women who serve in the UK Armed Forces and in particular to those who participated in this operation.</p>
