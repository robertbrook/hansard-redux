          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0667P0-08804">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Defence (Mr Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08805">Following the announcement on the 16 September of my preferred option for future military aircraft support and the end of the trade unions' consultation period, I am announcing my decision to implement the preferred option.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_28ws' title='Col. 28WS &mdash; HL Deb 30 November 2004 vol 667 c28WS' name='column_28ws' href='#column_28ws' rel='bookmark'>28WS</a><p id="S5LV0667P0-08806">This will mean that the support for the Tornado GR4 aircraft will be concentrated forward to the main operating base (MOB) at RAF Marham; with the work on Tornado F3 aircraft remaining "as is" with support being carried out at both the MOB and DARA St Athan until the aircraft's out-of-service date. Depth support for Lynx, Chinook and Sea King will be concentrated backwards to DARA Fleetlands.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08807">This decision is based on comprehensive analysis which was carried out on an objective and impartial basis, and offers the best outcome for defence in terms of operational effectiveness and value for money. It does, however, have implications for our military and civilian workforce, as well as for our partners in industry who undertake depth support of military aircraft.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08808">At the time of the announcement, it was made clear that the Ministry of Defence would explore with other government departments, including the Welsh Assembly and the Wales Office, alternative options for the viable and economic use of St Athan after 2009, based on its transformation into an aerospace centre of excellence. Officials from my department, along with DARA senior management, have already had meetings with Welsh Assembly and Wales Office staff to explore possible options, and have agreed a strategic approach for taking this forward as a matter of urgency.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08809">Implementation of the decision will be taken forward by the Chief of Defence Logistics&#x2014;as the process owner for defence logistics&#x2014;and responsible for the programme to deliver the changes to air depth support. Detailed consultation with the trade unions on the implementation of the decision will be taken forward.</p>
