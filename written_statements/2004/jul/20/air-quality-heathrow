          <p class="first-para">The Department is today making information available on its website concerning the programme of work promised in the "Future of Air Transport" White Paper to examine how to make best use of Heathrow's existing two runways, and how a third runway could be added after a new runway at Stansted, while complying with strict conditions on air quality, noise and improved public transport access. Copies of the information available today have also been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p><p>The most challenging issue confronting expansion at Heathrow is compliance with forthcoming EU air quality limits. In addressing this issue, we have set up three air quality panels&#x2014;involving independent experts supported by officials&#x2014;to help us review the data and methodology used in analysis underpinning the White Paper and to advise on any further research and data that may be required over the next 12&#x2013;18 months. In addition, work is underway with key stakeholders to explore the issues surrounding mixed mode operations and the options for improved surface access.</p><p>We are aiming to reach conclusions on the prospects for further development at Heathrow in time to contribute to the White Paper progress report promised
          
          <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_23ws' title='Col. 23WS &mdash; HC Deb 20 July 2004 vol 424 c23WS' name='column_23ws' href='#column_23ws' rel='bookmark'>23WS</a>
          for 2006. Any proposals that were not consulted on in the run up to the White Paper, such as the introduction of mixed mode, will require full public consultation.</p><p>Early work will be focused on evidence gathering and analysis. We are committed to keeping people involved in this process and informed of any significant developments. In addition to the information and documents that we are making available on the Department's website, we will also hold periodic meetings with stakeholders and interested parties. The information on the web site&#x2014;available at <span class="underline">www.dft.gov.uk/aviation/projectheathrow</span>&#x2014;provides a summary of the project and its work and gives details of the air quality panels. We will keep this information under review as the project progresses, adding material as appropriate and responding to the feedback we receive.</p>
