          <cite class='member author entry-title'><a href="/people/mr-peter-hain" title="Mr Peter Hain">The Leader of the House of Commons (Mr. Peter Hain)</a></cite>
          <p class="first-para">The Speaker has raised with me his concern, and that of other Members, about the number of "I will write" replies to parliamentary questions, and the inaccessibility of the subsequent responses. The matter was also raised by the Public Administration Committee in its report on "Ministerial Accountability and Parliamentary Questions" [Third Report, HC355, paragraph 29].</p><p>Following discussion with ministerial colleagues, and in consultation with Mr. Speaker and the House authorities, I have agreed the following arrangements, which will take effect from September.
          <q>Government Departments will continue to make every effort to provide a substantive answer to every parliamentary question within the customary timescale.</q>
          <q>Departments will give "I will write" answers only rarely, when there is particular reason for delay.</q>
          <q>At the end of each session, Departments will make every effort to answer questions substantively before prorogation; but, if this is not possible, Ministers will&#x2014;instead of issuing an "I will write" reply, as in the past&#x2014;answer the question with the following form of words: "It has not proved possible to respond to the [Right] hon. Member in the time available before Prorogation". It will then be open to the Member concerned to re-table the question in the new session if he or she wishes.</q>
          <q>On those occasions where an "I will write" answer is necessary, a copy of the subsequent substantive response will be sent to Hansard and to the Library, and will be printed with the written answers in the next edition of Hansard.</q>
          <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_36ws' title='Col. 36WS &mdash; HC Deb 21 July 2004 vol 424 c36WS' name='column_36ws' href='#column_36ws' rel='bookmark'>36WS</a>
          <q>If the subsequent response is longer than Hansard would normally publish, notification will be printed that the response is available in the Library of the House. The response will be available to Members in the Library and to the public on application to the House of Commons information office.</q>
          <q>If Ministers wish to provide, in response to a question, personal or confidential information that would not be appropriate for publication, this will be made clear in the answer. The "I will write" formula will not be used and copies will not be sent to Hansard or the Library.</q></p><p>I believe that these new arrangements will substantially reduce the number of "I will write" replies, and make the subsequent responses much more accessible both to other Members and to the public.</p>
