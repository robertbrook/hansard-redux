          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0664P0-10745">My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0664P0-10746">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects to publish in August new planning policy statements on both sustainable development in rural areas and renewable energy in England. These will be the first in a new series of planning policy statements that are being introduced as part of the Government's programme of reform to the planning system. The new planning policy statement 7 (PPS7) will replace existing planning policy guidance note 7 (PPG7), <span class="italic">The Countryside&#x2014;Environmental Quality and Economic and Social Development,</span> published in February 1997. The new planning policy statement 22 (PPS22) will replace existing planning policy guidance note 22 (PPG22): <span class="italic">Renewable Energy,</span> published in February 1993.</p><p id="S5LV0664P0-10747">A draft of PPS7 was issued for public consultation in September 2003. The key policy aims of PPS7 are to plan for and facilitate good quality, sustainable development to support thriving rural communities and businesses, while protecting the beauty and character of the countryside.</p><p id="S5LV0664P0-10748">A draft of PPS22 was issued for consultation in November 2003. The final document will be an important step towards facilitating the delivery of more renewable energy developments and thereby meeting this Government's commitments in respect of global warming and climate change.</p><p id="S5LV0664P0-10749">Local planning authorities will need to have regard to the policies in PPS7 and PPS22 in preparing their local development documents, as should regional planning bodies in the preparation of regional spatial strategies. The policies may also be material to decisions on individual planning applications.</p><p id="S5LV0664P0-10750">Copies of both PPS7 and PPS22 will be made available in the Libraries of the House following publication. They will also be made available on the website of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Copies of the responses to the consultation exercises will be made available for inspection through the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's library and lists of those responses will also be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

          statements are integral to the Government's programme of reforming the planning system.</p><p id="S5LV0664P0-10753">A draft of PPS 11 was issued for public consultation in October 2003. PPS 11 provides government guidance on the new arrangements for regional planning. The new procedural arrangements will better deliver policy at the regional level by giving more weight to what is currently regional planning guidance by replacing it with a statutory regional spatial strategy (RSS). The new local development documents will have to be in general conformity with this RSS, and the RSS will be made part of the development plan.</p><p id="S5LV0664P0-10754">A draft of PPS 12 was issued for public consultation in October 2003. PPS 12 provides government guidance on the new arrangements for the preparation of local development documents, which will comprise the local development framework. The local development framework is largely a portfolio of local development documents which collectively deliver the spatial planning strategy for the local planning authority's area. Local development frameworks are intended to streamline the local planning process and promote a proactive and positive approach to managing development.</p><p id="S5LV0664P0-10755">Copies of both PPS 11 and PPS 12 will be made available in the Libraries of the House following publication. They will also be made available on the website of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Copies of the responses to the consultation exercises will be made available for inspection through the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's library and lists of those responses will also be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
