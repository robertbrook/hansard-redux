          <p class="first-para">The new arrangements for child support came into operation for new cases and some linked old scheme cases from 3 March 2003. Progress has been slower than anticipated, chiefly due to problems with the new computer and telephony systems that are being progressively remedied by EDS, the service provider. Recovery has now proceeded to the stage at which the agency has sufficient confidence in the system's ability to handle new applications to permit it to undertake its own recovery programme to improve compliance and increase its clearance rate. The Department will continue to withhold substantial payments from EDS until more satisfactory system performance has been achieved.</p><p>

The total number of cases cleared continues to rise but, clearly, we need to do much more and the agency has instigated a programme designed to drive performance improvement and build on the progress made during 2003&#x2013;04, with further emphasis on achieving positive outcomes for families.</p><p>The poorest families are starting to gain significantly in real terms from the new system with the introduction of the child maintenance premium. This last quarter saw a further rise&#x2014;the highest quarterly rise to date&#x2014;with over 8,000 first child maintenance payments being made and bringing the total number of beneficiaries to over 25,000.</p><p>Whereas under the old system, most cases were closed before calculations were made, the reverse is now true. The ratio between those cases reaching calculation compared with those that closed remained consistent with previous quarters at around 6:4, comparing favourably with the ratio of 4:6 under the old scheme.</p><p>Technical issues precluded the reporting of reliable figures on compliance and throughput during 2003&#x2013;04 and this, in turn, has impacted the agency's ability to manage performance improvements. We still do not have complete, fully accurate or timely information on compliance. The best information now available suggests that, in March 2004, just over half of those non-resident parents due to make payments did so.</p><p>The agency is in the process of validating the compliance information it has for this quarter with the aim of providing this in future quarterly reports. We expect performance to improve progressively over the next year or so as the new arrangements move into steady state and better information is made available to support performance improvements.</p><p>A special exercise was undertaken to test accuracy at the end of 2003&#x2013;04. At the end of the first year of the new scheme, 82 per cent. of decisions checked were accurate to the nearest penny (against a target of 90 per cent.).</p><p>Average weekly child support maintenance payments to parents with care are shown in the table. Figures are for June 2004 only and are calculated as the total amount received and allocated divided by the number of cases.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_95ws' title='Col. 95WS &mdash; HC Deb 22 July 2004 vol 424 c95WS' name='column_95ws' href='#column_95ws' rel='bookmark'>95WS</a><p>
