          <p class="first-para">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister intends to publish in August Planning Policy Statements detailing the process by which Parts 1 and 2 of the <a href="/acts/planning-and-compulsory-purchase-act">Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act</a> (2004) are to be implemented. Planning Policy Statement 11 (PPS11) sets out the implementation process of Part 1&#x2014;Regional Functions and replaces Planning Policy Guidance 11&#x2014;Regional Planning, published in October 2000. Planning Policy Statement 12 (PPS12) sets out the implementation process of Part 2&#x2014;Local Development and replaces Planning Policy Guidance 12&#x2014;Development Plans published in December 1999. These Planning Policy Statements are integral to the Governments programme of reforming the planning system.</p><p>A draft of PPS 11 was issued for public consultation in October 2003. PPS11 provides Government guidance on the new arrangements for regional planning. The new procedural arrangements will better deliver policy at the regional level by giving more weight to what is currently Regional Planning Guidance by replacing it with a statutory Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS). The new local development documents will have to be in general conformity with this RSS, and the RSS will be made part of the development plan.</p><p>A draft of PPS12 was issued for public consultation in October 2003. PPS12 provides Government guidance on the new arrangements for the preparation of local development documents, which will comprise the local development framework. The local development framework is largely a "portfolio" of local development documents that collectively deliver the spatial planning strategy for the local planning authority's area. Local development frameworks are intended to streamline the local planning process and promote a proactive and positive approach to managing development.</p><p>Copies of both PPS11 and PPS12 will be made available in the Libraries of the House following publication. They will also be made available on the web site of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Copies of the responses to the consultation exercises will be made available for inspection through the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's library and lists of those responses will also be placed in the libraries of the House.</p>
