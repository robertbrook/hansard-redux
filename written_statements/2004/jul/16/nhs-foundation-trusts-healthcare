          <p class="first-para"> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health has made the following Written Ministerial Statement today.</p><p>Following my announcement on 19 November at col. 826 of my intention to set up a review of the first National Health Service foundation trusts, I wrote yesterday to the chair of the Healthcare Commission (whose statutory name is the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection), Sir Ian Kennedy, asking the commission to provide me with advice in accordance with its statutory obligations.</p><p>The review will consider the challenges, difficulties and experiences of those trusts which became NHS foundation trusts on 1 April 2004 and 1 July 2004, although the views and opinions of those trusts aspiring to be authorised this autumn will be important. In undertaking the review, the Healthcare Commission will need to work closely with the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts. However, the final report will be advice to me from the Healthcare Commission. I have previously made a commitment not to approve any new proposals for NHS foundation trust applications between autumn 2004 and autumn 2005, pending the outcome of this review.</p><p>The terms of reference for the review are:M</p><p>what evidence in general terms is there that NHS foundation trusts are using their powers to improve access to services; improve the quality of care for patients; engage the local community; and engage staff to deliver high quality care to patients and the population;</p><p>what obstacles have NHS foundation trusts faced and do they foresee in achieving the above objectives;</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_72ws' title='Col. 72WS &mdash; HL Deb 16 July 2004 vol 663 c72WS' name='column_72ws' href='#column_72ws' rel='bookmark'>72WS</a><p>what has been the impact of NHS foundation trusts, so far, on relationships within the local health economy;</p><p>in what ways are their governance arrangements assisting or impeding NHS foundation trusts in exercising their powers for the benefit of patients?</p><p>It is my expectation that the report of the outcome of the review will be published in summer 2005. Copies of my letter to Sir Ian have been placed in the Library.</p>
