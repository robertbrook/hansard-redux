          <p class="first-para">I have today placed in the Library of the House copies of the "Reducing Re-offending National Action Plan". This fulfils the Government's commitment to reducing re-offending through greater strategic direction and collaborative
          <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_5ws' title='Col. 5WS &mdash; HC Deb 19 July 2004 vol 424 c5WS' name='column_5ws' href='#column_5ws' rel='bookmark'>5WS</a>
          working. The plan aims to address the concerns raised in a number of important reports on the theme of rehabilitation, including the social exclusion unit report on "reducing re-offending by ex-prisoners" and the joint thematic report "Through the prison gate" by Her Majesty's chief inspector of prison and Her Majesty's chief inspector of probation.</p><p>Over 60 national action points have been agreed across Government within the key areas to support the rehabilitation of offenders. For each agreed action point, the plan suggests complementary activity for those working at local and regional level to consider. A complementary approach is being developed in Wales led by the correctional services and the Welsh Assembly Government.</p><p>The plan has been set within our radical proposals for improving the management of offenders through the creation of a National Offender Management Service (NOMS). The new service is a key building block in achieving integrated service delivery, with end-to-end case management and co-ordinated interventions focused on individual offenders.</p><p>The delivery of the Plan will be overseen by a cross-Government board of senior officials, chaired by the chief executive of NOMS, including representatives from key government departments responsible for complementary services such as health, education and training, employment and housing.</p>
