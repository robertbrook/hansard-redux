The following joint statement was agreed at this meeting.</p><p id="S5LV0665P0-09584">"The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Spain and the United Kingdom, Miguel Angel Moratinos and Jack Straw, have met in Madrid on 27 October 2004. During their meeting they discussed Gibraltar.</p><p id="S5LV0665P0-09585">The Ministers have agreed to consider and consult further on how to establish a new forum for dialogue on Gibraltar, with an open agenda, in which Gibraltar would have its own voice. The modalities for this dialogue will be agreed by all the concerned parties.</p><p id="S5LV0665P0-09586">Minister Straw welcomes the decision of the Spanish Government to promote local co-operation between Gibraltar and its surrounding area. Both Ministers are glad about the establishment of a Joint Committee Gibraltar Government-Mancomunidad del Campo de Gibraltar to promote the identification and implementation of mutually beneficial local co-operation projects and wish to set out their support for this initiative because of its intrinsic value and the confidence-building atmosphere that it could create. It is understood that for the Spanish Government this local co-operation is within the objectives of the Spanish Government in relation to the sovereignty of Gibraltar. It is also understood that the British Government fully maintains its commitment to honour the wishes of the people of Gibraltar as set out in the preamble of the 1969 Constitution.</p><p id="S5LV0665P0-09587">In the Annex are set out several co-operation measures to facilitate the start of the work of the previously mentioned forum.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_47ws' title='Col. 47WS &mdash; HL Deb 28 October 2004 vol 665 c47WS' name='column_47ws' href='#column_47ws' rel='bookmark'>47WS</a><p id="S5LV0665P0-09588">ANNEX
