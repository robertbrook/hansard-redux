          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0665P0-09527">My right honourable friend the Paymaster-General (Dawn Primarolo) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0665P0-09528">I said in a Written Answer on 11 March (<span class="italic">Official Report</span>, 11 March 2004, col. 1645W) that the timing of the phased transfer on to child tax credit (CTC) of the remaining families with children in receipt of income support/jobseeker's allowance, planned to begin from October, would be subject to a final review in the summer and that in the meantime, families would continue to receive the same level of support through their benefits as they would from CTC.</p><p id="S5LV0665P0-09529">It is extremely important to safeguard continuity of support for children among this particularly vulnerable group. Following further consideration of the proposed timetable, I have decided that the transfer should be deferred and begin instead in the course of next year. This will allow a full cycle of tax credits activity to be completed before these families are transferred in.</p><p id="S5LV0665P0-09530">Meanwhile, as I announced in March, I can again confirm that families will continue to receive the same level of financial support through their benefits as they would from CTC.</p>
