We welcome the committee&apos;s report and its reference to the progress the Government have made in implementing many of the independent review recommendations and the work undertaken to support the 2004 spending review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0665P0-09518"&gt;This progress will help bring stability to the Supporting People Programme, providing better opportunities for vulnerable people to live as independently as possible in their own home and community. Our work will continue to focus on ensuring that good quality, value-for-money housing-related support services are delivered to vulnerable people, and that Supporting People makes a positive difference to their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Supporting People Programme' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/oct/19/supporting-people-programme'></outline>
