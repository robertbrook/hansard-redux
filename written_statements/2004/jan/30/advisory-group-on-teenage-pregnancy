          <p class="first-para">Today, 30 January 2004, the Government published their response to the second annual report of independent advisory group on teenage pregnancy.</p><p>In their report, the independent advisory group raised a number of issues for the Government's consideration and made eight recommendations. We have carefully considered and responded specifically to the recommendations put forward by the independent advisory group in their second annual report.</p><p>We continue to make good progress in implementing the teenage pregnancy strategy, which remains a Government priority. We welcome the early signs that our long-term sustained efforts to reduce the rates of teenage pregnancy are working. This includes a 10 per cent. reduction in conception rates in under 18s and an 11 per cent. reduction among under 16s since 1998.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_24ws' title='Col. 24WS &mdash; HC Deb 30 January 2004 vol 417 c24WS' name='column_24ws' href='#column_24ws' rel='bookmark'>24WS</a><p>The strategy draws on the best available research evidence of what works. This is a multi-faceted approach with a range of measures to help young people resist pressure to have early sex, to improve sex and relationship education, to support parents in talking to their children about sex and relationship issues, to improve young people's access to contraceptive advice and to support teenage parents in participating in education, training and employment.</p><p>The strategy is very much in tune with the vision of the Green Paper, "Every Child Matters", which provides our vision of how to help every child and young person fulfil their potential.</p><p>The Government welcome the recommendations made in the independent advisory group's second annual report and acknowledge the valuable contribution the group makes to the strategy and its implementation.</p><p>Our response recognises that in order to sustain the success of the strategy we cannot give way to complacency. There are still many lessons to be learnt and much to do to reach our goal and help young people reach theirs.</p><p>A copy of the Government's response has been placed in the Libraries.</p>
