          <p class="first-para">The Department of Trade and Industry is helping business and other stakeholders adapt to changes to employment law and practice. Beginning in 2004, the DTI will implement those changes, which arise from within the UK and on which the Department leads, on only two dates in each year. It will also say at the beginning of each year, through an annual statement of forthcoming employment regulations, what those changes are expected to be.</p><p>The two common commencement dates are:
          <q>April 6&#x2014;the start of the tax year</q>
          <q>October 1&#x2014;when the minimum wage is revised</q></p><p>The harmonisation of commencement dates is intended to ensure that changes to employment policy are made in a co-ordinated fashion and to provide businesses, employee representatives and individuals with greater clarity and awareness about when changes will be made. This should assist all parties to plan for new measures and help implement them effectively. Other Government Departments are considering how they might follow the DTI's lead where appropriate.</p><p>This first annual statement details changes to employment law and practice that are due to commence in 2004 where DTI has the lead. It comprises of four Sections:
          <q>Section A details changes to employment law and practice that are due to commence on 6 April 2004</q>
          <q>Section B details changes to employment law and practice that are due to commence on 1 October 2004</q>
          <q>Section C details employment regulations arising from Europe where the coming into force date is different and not aligned to either common commencement date</q>
          <q>Section D details other key activity by DTI that will impact on the employment law framework in 2004 and beyond.</q></p><p>Further information on employment laws and the supporting framework is available on the DTI website <span class="underline">http://www.dti.gov.uk/er</span>/</p><p>Section A</p><p><span class="italic">Regulations to commence on 6 April 2004</span></p><p>Section A details changes to employment law and practice that are due to commence on 6 April 2004.</p><p>6 APRIL '04 CONDUCT OF EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES AND EMPLOYMENT BUSINESSES REGULATIONS</p><p>These regulations will apply to the private recruitment industry and will largely update the existing requirements that govern their conduct.

It is due to report on any fine-tuning of this recommendation in light of economic conditions in February 2004.</p><p>The Government have also asked the Commission to report by February 2004 on the possible introduction of a minimum wage for workers aged 16 and 17.

The changes will be included in the Department for Work and Pensions annual uprating order&#x2014;the Social Security Benefits Uprating Order 2004. For 2004, the increased rates will apply from Sunday 4 April.

          Employment and Race Directives under Article 13. Further consultation will take place during 2004. Legislation will come into force no later than October 2005.</p><p>Further information:</p><p><span class="underline">www.womenandequalityunit.gov.uk/legislation</span></p><p>OCTOBER 2006 AGE DISCRIMINATION LEGISLATION</p><p>Implementation of the elements of the European Discrimination Directive which will outlaw discrimination in employment on the grounds of age. The aim is to make draft regulations by end 2004, after further consultation in the Spring. To allow businesses and employee representatives sufficient time to prepare for the changes, the regulations will not be brought into force until October 2006.</p><p>Further information:</p><p><span class="underline">www.dti.gov.uk/er/equality/age.htm</span></p><p>Notes</p><p>The harmonisation of the commencement dates of employment regulations stems from a recommendation in the Better Regulation Taskforce 2002 report "Employment Regulation: Striking a balance". The Taskforce reported that a common complaint by employers was that changes to employment policy seem to happen in an uncoordinated fashion. It proposed common commencement dates for employment policy.</p><p>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced on 31 March 2003 that the DTI would take the following action:</p><p>6 April (the beginning of the tax year) and 1 October (when the minimum wage is revised) will become the two set commencement dates for domestic employment regulations for which the DTI is responsible.
          <q>For European legislation there will be a three stage approach:</q>
          <q>(i) the "coming into force" dates in 2003, which have been in the public domain for some time, will remain unchanged;</q>
          <q>(ii) from January 2004, the DTI will plan the "coming into force" dates for Directives where deadlines have already been set, but which have not yet been implemented, on a case-by-case basis;</q>
          <q>(iii) the DTI will aim to negotiate three-year transposition deadlines for future EU Directives so that it will have enough time to consult and still align with the two set dates.</q></p><p>Beginning in 2004, DTI will publish an annual statement of forthcoming employment regulations every January.</p><p>The DTI will ask central Government to foster inter-departmental co-operation with these changes.</p><p>In Budget 2003 the Chancellor said other Government Departments should adopt the same approach.
          <q>An email alert system (<span class="underline">www.dti.gov.uk/email/subscribe.htm</span>) is now available on the DTI website for users to subscribe. Over 3,000 people have already registered.</q></p>
