          <p class="first-para">The Small Business Service (SBS) is today publishing a Government action plan for small business. It builds on existing Government support for small business, marshalling the whole of government behind the small business agenda. I am placing copies in the Libraries of both Houses.</p><p>In December 2002, the SBS published <span class="italic">Small Business and Government</span>&#x2014;<span class="italic">The Way Forward</span>&#x2014;a strategic framework for a Government-wide approach to helping small businesses based around seven core themes: building an enterprise culture; encouraging a more dynamic start-up market; building the capability for small business growth; improving access to finance for small businesses; encouraging more enterprise in disadvantaged communities and under-represented groups; improving small businesses' experience of Government services; and developing better regulation and policy. These themes were identified as key drivers for economic growth, improved productivity and enterprise for all.</p><p>Since then, partners at national, regional and local level have worked together using the strategic framework to develop a set of practical actions focused on improving policy and delivery as it affects small business.</p><p>Actions identified in the plan, include:
          <q>Consideration being given to extending the concept of common commencement dates for legislative and regulatory changes subject to the results of the employment law pilot now underway. Government will consult business on the priority areas and preferred dates;</q>
          <q>A review of the routes off benefits into self-employment to establish if more can be done to encourage and facilitate moves into self employment;</q>
          <q>The launch of a "core offer" for start-ups defining the service that all start-up businesses, wherever they are located, can expect;</q>
          <q>Completion of the establishment of a Council for Graduate Entrepreneurship;</q>
          <q>The publication of a "no nonsense guide" to access to finance for small businesses;</q>
          <q>A second phase of the Government's Phoenix Fund, to encourage specialist business support and entrepreneurship in disadvantaged areas;</q>
          
          <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_13ws' title='Col. 13WS &mdash; HC Deb 08 January 2004 vol 416 c13WS' name='column_13ws' href='#column_13ws' rel='bookmark'>13WS</a>
          <q>The development of a small business procurement concordat, to be signed by public sector bodies; and</q>
          <q>Further work to improve the coherence, accessibility and quality of Government services for small businesses building on the success of the cross-Government <span class="underline">www.businesslink.gov.uk</span> portal available since November 2003.</q></p><p>Implementation of the Action Plan will require the involvement of a wide range of Government Departments and agencies and delivery partners. A web-based implementation programme is being made available at <span class="underline">www.sbs.gov.uk</span> setting out milestones and target dates for the implementation of the new actions. It will be updated on a regular basis to show the progress that is being made.</p>
