          Pensions, the benefit fraud inspectorate (BFI) has today announced its Phase 9 programme of activity for 2004&#x2013;05.</p><p>The BFI is an independent unit within the Department for Work and Pensions that inspects and reports directly to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on the standard of benefit administration and counter-fraud activity in local authorities and the Department's operations.</p><p>As part of its Phase 9 activity, the BFI will be undertaking shorter, targeted inspections focusing on the area of claims processing for housing benefits. The BFI will be selecting authorities that are taking 80 days or more to process housing benefits claims. Authorities will be selected on an on-going basis, depending on their quarterly management information returns to the Department for Work and Pensions.</p><p>Inspections on three other authorities&#x2014;Breckland, Copeland, and Wyre&#x2014;whose claims processing performance has improved significantly will be used to identify and disseminate good practice.</p><p>The BFI will be undertaking full inspections on 14 local authorities whose benefits administration has been identified as poor or fair in the Comprehensive Performance Assessment programme. Authorities whose assessment results have already been announced include Allerdale, Broxtowe, Hart, North Norfolk, Rossendale, Rutland, Torridge, and West Berkshire.</p><p>Full inspections on two other authorities&#x2014;Herefordshire and Rotherham&#x2014;who have shown significant improvements in their benefits administration during the comprehensive performance assessment programme will be used to identify and disseminate good practice.</p><p>The BFI will also be undertaking full inspections on Caerphilly and Merthyr Tydfil councils whose benefits service performance has been identified as at risk during the Wales programme for improvement.</p><p>The BFI will also be undertaking follow-up inspections on authorities to assess progress made since earlier BFI inspections.</p><p>Working with the Audit Commission, the BFI will continue to undertake the comprehensive performance assessments programme, undertaking assessments on 30 district authorities and re-assessing the performance of 116 single-tier authorities.</p><p>Working with Audit Scotland and the Audit Commission in Wales, BFI will continue its involvement in the Scottish best value programme and the Wales programme for improvement.</p><p>The BFI will also continue to offer practical support and advice to local authorities as part of its successful performance improvement action team. a service that has proved both popular and effective in improving performance in benefits administration. Demand for this service continues to increase.</p><p>Subject to further discussions, the BFI will be undertaking a specialist inspection on local authorities' compliance with disability discrimination Acts, and four specialist inspections on the business of the Department for Work and Pensions.</p>
