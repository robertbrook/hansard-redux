          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0659P0-09650">A team of FCO officials, RAF personnel, British police officers and independent observers visited Guantanamo Bay between 8 and 9 March 2004.</p><p id="S5LV0659P0-09651">The purpose of the visit was to return five British detainees to the UK, to check on the welfare of the four British detainees who remain there and to explain their position to them. The camp authorities were cooperative and helpful during the visit.</p><p id="S5LV0659P0-09652">An FCO official, accompanied by a police officer, informed the five British detainees on 8 March that they would be returned to the UK. Their return took place the following day, 9 March.</p><p id="S5LV0659P0-09653">An FCO official also met the other four British detainees individually. A US official observed the meetings. The FCO official delivered mail for the detainees personally and brought messages back to their families. Detainees are able to send and receive mail through the camp authorities and the ICRC. Delivery remains irregular. We are considering with the US Government ways for them to improve the mail arrangements.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_62ws' title='Col. 62WS &mdash; HL Deb 31 March 2004 vol 659 c62WS' name='column_62ws' href='#column_62ws' rel='bookmark'>62WS</a><p id="S5LV0659P0-09654">The FCO official asked all the British detainees about their health, diet, accommodation, opportunities for exercise and other camp facilities.</p><p id="S5LV0659P0-09655">The British detainees appeared to be in satisfactory physical health but are increasingly frustrated by their continued detention. Individual welfare issues are being pursued by British officials with the US Government.</p><p id="S5LV0659P0-09656">The FCO official informed the four British detainees that, following discussions between the British and US Governments, five other British detainees were to be returned to the UK; and that discussions between the two governments on their own future continued.</p><p id="S5LV0659P0-09657">The FCO official also informed Mr Abbasi and Mr Begg, both of whom have been designated by the US authorities as eligible for trial by military commission, that if they were to be tried, the British Government have told the US Government that the trial should be fair: and that the two governments continued to explore this and other possible courses of action.</p><p id="S5LV0659P0-09658">The legal proceedings against Mr Abbasi and Mr Begg were suspended in July 2003 pending discussions between the British and US governments. The British Government's position remains that either the British detainees should be tried in accordance with international standards or they should be returned to the UK. The British Government continue to work to resolve their position.</p>
