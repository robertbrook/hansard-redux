      <outline id='3540773' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Ivor Caplin)&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00356"&gt;With effect from 1 April 2004 the three single service personnel agencies will cease to have agency status. This decision resulted from the service personnel process review that was conducted last year and referred to by my right hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) on 17 July 2002,&lt;i&gt;Official Report,&lt;/i&gt; column 277&amp;#x2013;78W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00357"&gt;The review also identified the fact that the career management and manpower planning work of the three service manning agencies did not wholly suit agency status, because they performed primarily support and enabling functions rather than being concerned with the provision of a clear and discrete deliverable service. I therefore concluded that agency status for the agencies (Naval Manning, Army Personnel and RAF Personnel Management Agency) should cease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00358"&gt;I am pleased to tell the House that a considerable amount of work continues in many other areas. It includes further reviews of tri-service recruiting and welfare and many of the review recommendations have been swept into a service personnel plan, parallel with and linked to the equipment programme and within the framework of the defence White Paper published last December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00359"&gt;I intend to report on further progress to the House later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Service Personnel Process Review' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/mar/17/service-personnel-process-review'></outline>

However, where they decide to participate in such activity they should do so in accordance with the requirements of this guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09442"&gt;Copies of the guidance have been placed in the Libraries of the House.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Referendum Guidance' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/mar/17/referendum-guidance'></outline>
