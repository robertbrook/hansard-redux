          <li>1. This target is measured by a points score system which focuses efforts and resources on helping into work people in priority groups such as lone parents, disabled people and those in the most disadvantaged areas. For each person that Jobcentre Plus places in work it will earn a point score ranging from 12 points for, for example, a lone parent, to one point for someone who is already employed. </li>
          <li>2. This target measures standards of delivery of five key Jobcentre Plus business processes: Income Support accuracy, Jobseeker's Allowance accuracy, Incapacity Benefit accuracy, Labour Market Interventions, and attendance at an independent assessment to identify basic skills needs.</li>
          <li>3. Excludes stayed cases awaiting decision in lead cases in a higher court (the effective date will commence from withdrawal of stay being notified).</li>
          <li>4. Excludes cases requiring further evidence.</li>
