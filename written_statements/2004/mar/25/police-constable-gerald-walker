          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0419P2-00587">Today I am publishing and placing in the Library the report of the inquiry by Her Majesty's chief inspector of probation into the death of police constable Gerald Walker. In his report, the chief inspector makes a number of recommendations for changes to the way in which the probation, prison and police services manage the release on licence, supervision and revocation of licence of<a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_62ws' title='Col. 62WS &mdash; HC Deb 25 March 2004 vol 419 c62WS' name='column_62ws' href='#column_62ws' rel='bookmark'>62WS</a>
          offenders who are serving part of their sentence under supervision in the community. The services have accepted those recommendations in full. I am therefore able to report that I am today also placing in the Library a copy of the detailed action plan which I have agreed with the key correctional services agencies to ensure that the lessons of PC Walker's tragic death are learned and appropriate changes are introduced.</p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00588">Police constable Walker was a serving officer of the Nottinghamshire constabulary at the time of his death at the hands of David Parfitt in Nottingham following the tragic events of 7 January last year. Parfitt had been convicted of robbery on 16 May 2002 and sentenced to two years imprisonment. He was released into the supervision of staff of the Nottinghamshire probation area on 11 September 2002. His licence, which in the normal way would have run until 13 March 2003 included among other conditions, a requirement that Parfitt undergo regular testing for the presence of class A drugs as arranged by the probation service. He was also subject for the first 60 days of his period in the community to an electronically monitored home detention curfew condition which required that he remain at his approved address between 7.15 pm and 7.15 am.</p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00589">At the time PC Walker was killed, Parfitt had completed his period of home detention curfew without breaking the conditions of that curfew, but had recorded a number of positive tests for the presence of class A drugs and had failed to attend a number of appointments with his supervising officer. As a consequence, his supervising officer had requested, and the Home Office approved, the revocation of Mr Parfitt's licence on 9 December 2002.</p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00590">Parfitt was unlawfully at large from that date until 8 January 2003, when he was arrested by the Nottinghamshire police. During that time, Parfitt caused the injuries to PC Walker from which he subsequently died when the officer fell from a vehicle in which Parfitt was seeking to escape. Parfitt was subsequently convicted of manslaughter for the death of PC Walker and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.</p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00591">PC Gerald Walker's attempts to arrest David Parfitt were the actions of a brave man and a dedicated police officer. They deserve the unreserved commendation of the House. His death as a consequence of Parfitt's actions was an irreparable loss to the Nottinghamshire police service and the people of Nottingham, but even more a personal tragedy for his wife and family. I know that I speak for the whole House in expressing my deepest sympathy and condolences to Mrs. Tracy Walker for her loss.</p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00592">Following PC Walker's death, Mrs Walker was not satisfied that the correctional services agencies had been as open with her about the circumstances of her husband's death as they were required to be. She was concerned that failures in the way in which Parfitt's case had been handled had actually contributed to the situation which led to the death of her husband. She formally complained to the national probation service and on 13 December last year I, together with my hon. Friend the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety, asked HM Chief Inspector of Probation, Professor Rod Morgan, to carry out an
          
          <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_63ws' title='Col. 63WS &mdash; HC Deb 25 March 2004 vol 419 c63WS' name='column_63ws' href='#column_63ws' rel='bookmark'>63WS</a>
          inquiry into the actions of the prison service, Nottinghamshire probation area and Nottinghamshire constabulary in relation to the events which culminated in and followed the death of PC Walker.</p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00593">I have now received the report of that inquiry. On behalf of myself and my hon. Friend I would like to take this opportunity to thank the chief inspector and his team for the scrupulous manner in which they have approached this important and sensitive inquiry.</p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00594">Professor Morgan's report covers issues at both the local, operational level and in respect of the national policy which informed local practice. He reports that he found a number of failings in the handling of Parfitt's case which, if carried out differently, could have resulted in the earlier revocation of his licence and the possibility of his earlier arrest. He makes a number of recommendations for changes affecting all three services which he believes will reduce the risk of similar failings arising in future and which will contribute to the greater safety of the public.</p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00595">Professor Morgan also identifies serious flaws in the way that the Probation Service dealt with Mrs Walker.</p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00596">Professor Morgan has identified a number of areas in which our present practice for the safe management of offenders in the community can and should be improved. The Government and services accept Professor Morgan's analysis and will implement the changes he proposes. The action plan I have today placed in the Library sets out how we propose to take forward the implementation of the key recommendations outlined by the inquiry report.</p>
