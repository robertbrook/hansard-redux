          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0419P2-00710">The Department has carried out a review of the basis for charging for a number of plant health, plant varieties and animal health services that it provides.

The conclusion is that for the following services the legislative basis was not sufficient to allow the Department to impose a charge:</p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00712"><span class="italic">Plant Health</span>

          </ol></p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00715">A parallel review of Forestry Commission services has found that the legislative base for export charges of forest trees and forest products was not sufficient to impose a charge. Invoicing for this service was also suspended whilst the review was completed.</p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00716">Action will now be taken to repay to customers some &#x00A3;2.4 million of charges that were levied over the six years prior to the suspension of charging.
