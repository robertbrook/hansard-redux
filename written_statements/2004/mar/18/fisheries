          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0419P2-00367">From 1 January 1999 all British registered fishing vessels over 10m in length and catching more than 2 tonnes of quota stocks have had to demonstrate an economic link with fisheries dependent communities in the United Kingdom. This link can be demonstrated in a number of ways&#x2014;for example, by vessels landing at least 50 per cent. by weight of their quota catch into the UK or by employing a crew of whom at least 50 per cent. are normally resident in a UK coastal area.</p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00368">In 2002, 1,362 vessels caught more than 2 tonnes of quota stocks and in each case achieved a satisfactory economic link, primarily through landings into the UK.</p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00369">The arrangements have also resulted in UK registered but foreign-owned vessels continuing to land and incur expenditure at UK ports or making quota available for re-distribution to the inshore fleet. Compared with 1998, benefits have included:
          <q>a 40 per cent. increase in the volume of quota stocks landed into the UK by foreign owned UK registered vessels. This figure is proportionally higher when viewed against cuts in TACs since 1998;</q>
          <q>a significant increase in the number of landings into the UK by Anglo-Spanish vessels, resulting in additional expenditure at our ports of some &#x00A3;3 million; and</q>
          <q>the provision of almost 500 tonnes of quota for redistribution to our inshore fleet, notably nephrops, North Sea sole and North Sea cod.</q></p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00370">A full report by the fisheries departments in the United Kingdom on the operation of the economic link measures in 2002 and their impact has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
