          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0659P0-09419">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education (Alan Johnson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0659P0-09420">I am today publishing the results of the consultation on proposed new criteria for degree awarding powers and university title, which ended on 12 December 2003. The consultation followed a commitment in the White Paper <span class="italic">The Future of Higher Education</span> to modernise the criteria governing the granting of degree awarding powers (DAP) and to allow university title (UT) to be granted on the basis of taught DAP and student numbers.</p><p id="S5LV0659P0-09421">There were mixed views on the proposal to allow teaching-focused universities, with universities generally opposed and other higher education institutions (HEls) in support. Most respondents felt the proposed criteria for taught DAP were clearer than the current criteria and strengthen the requirements staff have to meet.

          reputation of higher education in England and Wales is maintained. The moratorium on new applications for degree awarding powers will remain in place while this matter is discussed further with the higher education sector and others. In the mean time, the moratorium on new applications for university title under the current criteria is lifted.</p><p id="S5LV0659P0-09423">The consultation report has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and is available on the Department for Education and Skills website at: <a class='resolved-url' href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/consultations/conResults.cfm">www.dfes.gov.uk/consultations/conResults.cfm</a>?consultationId = 1226</p>
