          <p class="first-para" id="S6CV0419P2-00308">I am today publishing the results of the consultation on proposed new criteria for degree awarding powers and university title, which ended on 12 December 2003. The consultation followed a commitment in the White Paper "The Future of Higher Education" to modernise the criteria governing the granting of degree awarding powers (DAP) and to allow university title (UT) to be granted on the basis of taught DAP and student numbers.</p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00309">There were mixed views on the proposal to allow teaching-focused universities, with universities generally opposed and other higher education institutions (HEIs) in support. Most respondents felt the proposed criteria for taught DAP were both clearer than the current criteria and strengthen the requirements staff have to meet. Most universities supported retaining the current student number criterion for UT with other HEIs divided on whether the level should be maintained or lowered. More respondents than not were in favour of allowing specialist institutions to be eligible for UT.</p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00310">The proposal for DAP in future to be granted for six year terms, renewable subject to a satisfactory audit was opposed by most respondents. Two-thirds of universities and virtually all other HEIs expressing an opinion were against the proposal. The Standing Committee of Principals cited legal difficulties with the proposed changes. In light of these concerns, we will issue a discussion paper on renewable DAP shortly. We want to balance the concerns expressed with the Government's desire to ensure that the quality and reputation of higher education in England and Wales is maintained. The moratorium on new applications for degree awarding powers will remain in place whilst this matter is discussed further with the higher education sector and others. In the meantime, the moratorium on new applications for university title under the current criteria is lifted.</p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00311">The consultation report has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and is available on the Department for Education and Skills website at:</p><p id="S6CV0419P2-00312"><span class="underline">www.dfes.gov.uk/consultations/comResults.cfm? consultationld=1226.</span></p>
