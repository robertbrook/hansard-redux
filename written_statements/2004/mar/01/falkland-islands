          <p class="first-para">I made a statement to this House on airlinks between the Falklands and Argentina,<span class="italic">Official Report,</span> 19 January 2004, 51WS. I would like to report on developments since then.</p><p>I travelled to Argentina on 16&#x2013;17 February on a pre-planned bilateral visit. I held talks on a wide range of international, regional and bilateral issues. The question of airlinks featured in my talks with the Argentine Foreign Minister, Dr Rafael Bielsa. The talks were frank and constructive and we made some progress. Some proposals were discussed which we each agreed to look at further. These proposals primarily focused on temporary arrangements for charter flights for 2004. I made it clear that any arrangements would need to be acceptable to the Falkland Islanders.</p><p>Regrettably, shortly following my visit, an article appeared in an Argentine newspaper, giving details of my talks and wrongly asserting that a deal on airlinks had been agreed. As I have indicated, this was not the case.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_74ws' title='Col. 74WS &mdash; HC Deb 01 March 2004 vol 418 c74WS' name='column_74ws' href='#column_74ws' rel='bookmark'>74WS</a><p>I spoke subsequently to Falkland Councillors. They concluded that the proposals for temporary arrangements did not meet their concerns. However, they agreed that we should continue to discuss the issue with the Argentine Government with a view to securing a permanent solution to the question of charter flights rather than having further temporary arrangements.</p><p>We are now taking this forward with the Argentine Government, with the full agreement of Councillors. I will keep the House informed of progress.</p>
