      <outline id='3540659' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Ivor Caplin)&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00524"&gt;A key principle of the Government&apos;s approach to addressing the health concerns of veterans of the 1990&amp;#x2013;91 Gulf conflict is that there should be appropriate research into veterans&apos;&lt;col&gt;52WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;illnesses and factors that may have a bearing on these. Our current research programme is expected to cost at least &amp;#x00A3;8.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00525"&gt;As part of this research effort, the Ministry of Defence funded an independent study of the reproductive health of UK veterans of the 1990&amp;#x2013;91 Gulf conflict through the Medical Research Council (MRC). The main findings of this research have today been published in a paper entitled: "Miscarriage, stillbirth and congenital malformation in the offspring of UK veterans of the first Gulf war" in the &lt;i&gt;"International Journal of Epidemiology".&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00526"&gt;The researchers have reported that for male veterans of the 1990&amp;#x2013;1991 Gulf conflict, they found no evidence for increased risk of stillbirth, chromosomal malformations, or congenital syndromes. Some associations were reported between fathers&apos; service and increased risk of miscarriage and other less well-defined malformations. For female veterans, the number of stillbirths and malformations were too small to allow meaningful analysis and there was no effect on the risk of miscarriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00527"&gt;The MOD welcomes publication of this important research. The MRC&apos;s military health research advisory group (MHRAG) has considered the paper. They agree with the researchers that overall, the lack of evidence to link reproductive health problems with Gulf service should be reassuring to veterans and that the apparent increased risk identified should be interpreted with caution. The MHRAG does not intend to recommend any additional research into this aspect of Gulf veterans&apos; health at this time.&lt;/p&gt;' title="Gulf Veterans' Illnesses" type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/mar/24/gulf-veterans-illnesses'></outline>

It also ensures that any relaxation of the restrictions in&lt;col&gt;54WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;the Audit Commission Act can be applied at the same time in England and Wales, following consultation with the National Assembly for Wales of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00535"&gt;The Government acknowledge the concerns that have been raised about this clause. Indeed, section 49 of the Audit Commission Act is already being considered as part of a much wider review of statutory restrictions on disclosure that the Government are undertaking. This is the Department for Constitutional Affairs&apos; review into existing statutory prohibitions on disclosure. Such restrictions can be removed by order under section 75 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 in the case of Acts passed before or in the same session as that Act.

This report outlines the continuing progress that the Ministry of Defence is making in implementing the estate strategy that was launched in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09530"&gt;The Ministry of Defence is continually examining ways of improving military capability and value for money for the taxpayer. As part of this approach, we want to keep the size and location of our bases under review. Building on initial work that has been done to identify the MoD&apos;s core sites, the department is now undertaking further work to examine where estate rationalisation may be possible. This work is consistent with the department&apos;s contribution to the Government&apos;s independent review of public sector rationalisation&amp;#x2014;the Lyons review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09531"&gt;The work now under way is looking at consolidating defence activity at a smaller number of more densely utilised locations in order to achieve the optimum use of land and facilities. This ongoing review will necessarily involve the examination of a number of proposals for the potential collocation and relocation of units. It will also take into account existing relocation studies that have already been announced. It is important to recognise that any options that are considered will need to meet operational requirements as well as representing value for money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09532"&gt;The department is currently at an early stage of this wider review and each proposal that emerges from this work will be subject to full consultation in the normal way. This consultation is essential to determine whether the options under consideration are viable in the widest sense, for instance, in relation to transport, education, health and the future use of potential surplus MoD sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09533"&gt;No decisions have yet been reached on any site but as this matter progresses I will ensure that right honourable and honourable Members are advised of progress where such an issue may affect their constituency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09534"&gt;A copy of the report is in the Library of the House.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Defence Estate Stewardship Report' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/mar/24/defence-estate-stewardship-report'></outline>

Violence broke out between ethnic Serbs and Albanians in Mitrovica in northern Kosovo, which subsequently spread to other ethnic Serb populated areas in Kosovo. The violence has resulted in deaths within both communities, as well as hundreds injured, including some KFOR troops. The situation in Kosovo, although still tense, now appears calmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09537"&gt;The troops already in Kosovo were heavily committed in dealing with the situation. Commander KFOR therefore took the decision to authorise the deployment of his in-theatre tactical reserves to assist with the situation. NATO also issued instructions to reinforce KFOR with additional SFOR troops from Bosnia, including a UK company of 1st Royal Gurkha Rifles, a US company and a company from the Italian Multinational Support Unit (Carabineri).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09538"&gt;In the early hours of Thursday 18 March. NATO called upon the Operational Reserve Force (ORF) Ready Battalion. The ready battalion role is one that the UK has responsibility for during the first six months of 2004. This means that, as part of our overall commitment to the Balkans, the UK provides NATO with a battalion that could, in circumstances such as these, be rapidly deployed into either Bosnia or Kosovo. The lead elements of the ORF, totalling approximately 150 men and 12 Land Rovers, departed from RAF Brize Norton on Thursday afternoon and landed in Kosovo late that evening. The vast majority of the ORF battalion of around 660 men has now deployed. 1st Battalion The Royal Gloucestershire Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment are providing the core of the battalion group. There are now around 1,100 UK Armed Forces personnel deployed in Kosovo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09539"&gt;The purpose of this deployment is to restore calm to the province and prevent unrest spreading to areas outside Kosovo&amp;#x2014;the type of task for which the Operational Reserve was designed. UK troops will conduct routine patrolling, the guarding of sites (such as the UN mission) and public order duties, as tasked by Commander KFOR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09540"&gt;Further to the deployment of the UK battalion, NATO has requested that an element of the NATO Strategic Reserve Force, provided by a French battalion, also be deployed to Kosovo. NATO has also requested the deployment of the three standby battalions that make up the full Operational Reserve Force. These battalions are provided by the US, Germany and Italy. The German battalion has been deployed to Skopje, Macedonia, in the first instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09541"&gt;It is for NATO to determine how long reserves will be required, but in terms of an initial estimate, and with the situation changing, we believe a sensible course of action is to initially plan for a deployment period of approximately 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Kosovo: Deployment of British Forces' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/mar/24/kosovo-deployment-of-british-forces'></outline>
