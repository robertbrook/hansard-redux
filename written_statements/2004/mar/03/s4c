          <p class="first-para">Following a request from the S4C Authority, I have commissioned an independent review of S4C, to be carried out by Roger Laughton, Head of Bournemouth university media school. Mr. Laughton will be assisted by Meurig Royles as Welsh language assessor to the review.</p><p>The terms of reference for the review are: 1) to assess, in light of the <a href="/acts/communication-act">Communication Act</a>'s reaffirmation of S4C's status and remit, <span class="italic">(a)</span> the efficiency with which S4C utilises the resources made available to deliver its statutory responsibilities, <span class="italic">(b)</span> the extent to which other sources of funding, including efficiency savings, could make a greater contribution alongside that which S4C receives as grant-in-aid, and <span class="italic">(c)</span> the extent to which S4C's latest strategic plan provides an effective basis on which to plan for the future; 2) to examine the particular implications for S4C of the Government's proposal on the future of digital broadcasting.</p><p>The review will include: <span class="italic">(a)</span> consultation with a wide range of interests, including organisations representative of those sectors where the role of S4C is of particular significance; and <span class="italic">(b)</span> consideration, to the extent that the reviewer judges appropriate, of the outcome of and evidence generated by S4C's recent internal review process.</p><p>In addition to the consultation outlined above, there will be an opportunity for members of the public to make representations to the review team, via a website set up by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</p><p>The Government remain committed to the provision by S4C of a high-quality, diverse Welsh language television service forming a key part of the public service broadcasting landscape. I was, therefore, pleased to agree to the S4C Authority's request for a review which could address some of the important challenges S4C faces as it approaches analogue switch off. The Authority has already completed its own internal review and Mr. Laughton will be able to take its conclusions into account.</p><p>Ofcom's, statutory review of the fulfillment of the public service broadcasting remit will also provide an opportunity to consider S4C's contribution to that wider remit. The relationship between S4C and the BBC will in addition be considered in detail as part of BBC charter review.</p><p>I have asked Mr. Laughton to report back to me at the beginning of May.</p>
