          <p class="first-para">I announced in response to a Question from the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) <a href="/commons/2004/mar/08/european-communities-association#column_1245">8 March 2004,<span class="italic">Official Report,</span> columns 1245&#x2013;52</a>, that I had ordered a full investigation of how it came about that guidance was issued to staff in the Sheffield office of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate on the handling of applications under the European Union Accession agreements without my knowledge or that of senior IND management.</p><p>The investigation is being conducted by Ken Sutton, Senior Director (Asylum), who is outside the management line for the Sheffield office. Its terms of reference are:
          <q>To investigate:</q>
          <q>The circumstances in which guidance has been issued to IND staff in the General Casework Section in Sheffield since September 2003 on the handling of applications made under the EC Association Agreements; on what authority this guidance was issued; and what steps, if any, were taken to seek higher authority or consult more -widely within the organisation;</q>
          <q>To establish the facts; and</q>
          <q>To make recommendations for addressing deficiencies in management which are revealed, to prevent any recurrence;</q>
          <q>To make an interim report on the factual position by 18 March, and a final report by the end of March".</q></p><p>Mr Sutton commenced his investigation on 9 March, and has interviewed most of the staff involved. He is now piecing together the precise circumstances in which the guidance was issued. I have asked him to give me an interim report on the facts of the matter by 18 March. I have also asked Mr Sutton to report on current, longstanding and any previous exercises over the last 10 years for dealing with backlogs.</p><p>In the meantime, IND senior management has decided that management in the Sheffield general casework office needs to be significantly strengthened. An experienced senior manager is being moved in to take charge of this office with effect from Monday.</p><p>There have been questions about the number of ECAA applications. From internal management information, it is estimated that just over 19,000 applications under the ECAA route were received in 2002&#x2013;03 and around 36,000 to date in 2003&#x2013;04. Of these, just over 18,500 and 29.000 respectively were from people already lawfully in the country but who are simply seeking to extend their stay or change the basis on which they are here. Some 600 applications in 2002&#x2013;03 and just over 7,000 to date in 2003&#x2013;04 were from people overseas seeking entry clearance. The total number of decisions in these cases from September 2003 to date is around 26,000. Again, the vast majority of these individuals were already here lawfully. Of these, just over 25,000 were approved and nearly 800 were either refused or fell for other reasons.</p><p>The Department has a duty of confidentiality regarding discipline and employment and a general duty of care to staff. In accordance with our normal policy, we will not release or confirm the names of members of staff during the course of this investigation.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_113ws' title='Col. 113WS &mdash; HC Deb 12 March 2004 vol 418 c113WS' name='column_113ws' href='#column_113ws' rel='bookmark'>113WS</a>
