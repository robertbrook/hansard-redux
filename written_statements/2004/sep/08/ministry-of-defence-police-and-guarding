          <p class="first-para">Key Targets have been set for the chief executive of the Ministry of Defence Police and Guarding Agency (MDPGA) for the financial year 2004;&#x2013;05. This year the key targets focus on MDP and<a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_122ws' title='Col. 122WS &mdash; HC Deb 08 September 2004 vol 424 c122WS' name='column_122ws' href='#column_122ws' rel='bookmark'>122WS</a>
          work is ongoing to establish an effective and joined up performance management system that will fully incorporate the MGS and MDP from next year.</p><p>The targets are as follows:</p><p><span class="italic">Key Target 1:</span>
          <q>By March 2005, as a means of providing greater public reassurance, ensure that no more than 25 per cent. of the duty time of dedicated patrol officers is expended on activities not directly related to patrol duties.</q></p><p><span class="italic">Key Target 2:</span>
          <q>By 31 March 2005, as a means of reducing crime and protecting MOD property and interests, achieve a crime-solving rate of 50 per cent. for the investigation of primary crime.</q></p><p><span class="italic">Key Target 3:</span></p><p>
          <q>By 31 March 2005, in order to delivery performance as defined in relevant establishment CSAs, ensure that the Agency fulfils at least 95 per cent. of its funded and agreed customer taskings.</q></p><p><span class="italic">Key Target 4:</span>
          <q>By 31 March 2005, in order to maintain appropriate levels of security as defined in relevant MDP CSAs, seek to maintain and improve upon the average baseline Security Contribution Index score achieved in the previous quarter at each establishment contributing to the index system.</q></p><p><span class="italic">Key Target 5:</span>
          <q>By 31 March 2005, within the overall recruitment of police staff, and as part of an overall programme to retain personnel levels, to have recruited at least 15 per cent. women and 4 per cent. from minority ethnic communities.</q></p><p><span class="italic">Key Target 6:</span>
          <q>By 31 March 2005, excepting unforeseen operational commitments, and with the intention of providing cost effective policing and guarding, as well as maintaining an appropriate work life balance for personnel, reduce the amount of overtime worked by each officer to no more than eight hours worked per week averaged over a 17 week rolling period.</q></p><p><span class="italic">Key Target 7:</span>
          <q>By 31 March 2005, in order to maintain a healthy and effective workforce and contribute to the achievement of other key targets, reduce the overall level of sickness lost within the Agency (except MGS personnel) by one hour per member of staff per month against the corresponding achievement in the previous year.</q></p><p><span class="italic">Key Target 8:</span>
          <q>By 31 March 2005, to have provided a greater clarity as to the extent of fraud within the MOD and thereby to have raised the awareness, by engaging with, and encouraging the MOD community to provide intelligence, with a view to increasing the number of reported fraud cases.</q></p>
