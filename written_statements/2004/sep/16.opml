      <outline id='3578297' text='Miss McIntosh&lt;p&gt;To ask the Solicitor General what recent assessment she has made of the effectiveness of pre-trial reviews in the magistrates courts. [187946]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Solicitor-General&lt;p&gt;Service has played an active, collaborative part in the Effective Trial Management Programme (ETMP), an initiative involving criminal justice agencies, and the judiciary, to plan, design and introduce non-legislative case management reforms heralded in the Government&apos;s White Paper, Justice for All.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During 2003, ETMP has tested a range of improvements to the pre-trial process in six criminal justice areas. These have included measures designed to ensure that pre-trial hearings in the magistrates&apos; courts are held only where necessary to progress a case to an effective trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in Essex, the first Area to introduce changes to the management of magistrates&apos; courts cases, almost all contested cases are progressed outside of&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;1654W&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;formal court hearings by case progression officers based in the courts, the CPS, and the police, working with the local judiciary, and a named contact for the defence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been an independent evaluation of the changes introduced in Essex, which has calculated that this process change could result in a saving of 8,640 hearings in a year, leading to more efficient utilisation of courtroom time; a decrease in ineffective trials; and improved timeliness. Other test areas have introduced similar changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guidance on how cases might be managed most effectively and efficiently from pre-charge through to conclusion, including the good practice and learning points from the ETMP test areas, is now contained within the Criminal Case Management Framework (CCMF). The Lord Chief Justice, the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor, the Attorney General and Baroness Scotland jointly issued the Framework on 21 July 2004. It states that "hearings before the court may take place if there is a material failure likely to affect the proper progress of the case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All other remaining criminal justice areas are now planning, designing or implementing similar changes to the process.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Pre-trial Reviews' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/pre-trial-reviews'></outline>

[187509]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawn Primarolo&lt;p&gt;Conditional exemption is granted or refused by the Inland Revenue rather than by the Acceptance in Lieu Panel. Exemption depends on the making of an acceptable undertaking in relation to preservation and access as well as on the standard of quality referred to in the question. The Inland Revenue have taken advice on quality from the Acceptance in Lieu Panel in cases where pre-eminent quality is required, following the changes in Finance Act 1998; prior to that the Inland Revenue sought advice directly from appropriate experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The available information is as follows: the figures show the number of objects or groups which remain exempt, net of the relatively small number of cases where relief given in the years shown has, subsequently been withdrawn, e.g. following a sale. The year shown is the year in which the exemption claims were finally granted and not the year of death or other transfer which determines the quality standard applicable to the claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x000A;&lt;table&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td colspan="2" align="center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Number of objects or groups of objects &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;Year&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Museum Quality&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pre-eminent&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;1994&amp;#x2013;95&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;3,525&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&amp;#x2014;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;1995&amp;#x2013;96&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;7,651&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&amp;#x2014;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;1996&amp;#x2013;97&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;1,406&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&amp;#x2014;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;1997&amp;#x2013;98&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;3,135&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&amp;#x2014;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;1998&amp;#x2013;99&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;4,085&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&amp;#x2014;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;1999&amp;#x2013;00&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;2,690&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&amp;#x2014;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/table&gt;&#x000A;&lt;image src="S6CV0424P2I0929"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;1655W&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;&lt;table&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td colspan="2" align="center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Number of objects or groups of objects&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;Year&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Museum Quality&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pre-eminent&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;2000&amp;#x2013;01&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;7,101&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;2001&amp;#x2013;02&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;1,395&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;2000&amp;#x2013;03&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;3,067&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;61&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;2003&amp;#x2013;04&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;1,060&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;700&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;2004&amp;#x2013;05 (to date)&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&amp;#x2014;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;99&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/table&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Boris Johnson&lt;p&gt;To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what percentage of&lt;i&gt;(a)&lt;/i&gt; museum quality and&lt;i&gt;(b)&lt;/i&gt; pre-eminent objects considered by the Acceptance in Lieu Panel were granted conditional exemption in each year since 1994.

Objects subject to the previous test were referred by the Inland Revenue directly to appropriate experts. Formal assessment of quality is the last substantive step in processing a claim, and apart from cases currently being finalised all cases which have reached the relevant quality standard have been granted exemption. The information available for cases rejected by the Revenue&apos;s advisers is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All cases considered up to and including 1999&amp;#x2013;2000 were subject to the quality standard applicable prior to Finance Act 1998; the split of rejected cases in subsequent; years between that standard and the preeminent standard required by Finance Act 1998 is not readily obtainable

Many allergy sufferers are not chronically sick or disabled; however, these reliefs may apply to allergy relief products in certain limited circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the introduction VAT, in the UK, allergy relief products supplied in all other circumstances are liable to VAT at the standard rate which, since 1 April 1991, has been 17.5 per cent. Prior to that, the standard rate of VAT was as follows: from 1 April 1973&amp;#x2013;10 per cent.; from 29 July 1974&amp;#x2013;8 per cent.; from 18 June 1979&amp;#x2013;15 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-standing formal agreements with our European partners allow us to keep our existing VAT zero rates, but do not allow us to extend them or introduce any new ones.

[187479]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alun Michael&lt;p&gt;The EU proposal on REACH requires information to be gathered on chemicals in order to provide the basis for protecting human health and the environment. This information may come from a number of sources, one of which is animal testing. The Commission has estimated that this draft Regulation will require data to be gathered on approximately 30,000 chemicals. Of these, 20,000 are thought to be produced or imported in quantities of less than 10 tonnes. At this tonnage the current Commission proposal requires 25 animals per chemical, although it should be remembered that in most cases the tests are expected to demonstrate that the chemical concerned is safe and therefore involves no threat to humans or animals. It is a key objective of the UK Government's work on REACH to keep animal testing to a minimum. Discussions are continuing on that basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission proposal would require further data as tonnage increases to reflect the greater potential human and environmental exposure. The tests performed need to comply with the relevant requirements for the protection of laboratory animals set out in Directive 86/609/EEC where, among other things, methods used must be refined in such a way as to minimise the amount of suffering caused to the animals concerned. Further, the chemical industry already has some of this data and there are other sources of information such as modelling of data and grouping of chemicals to read-across data from one chemical to another, all of which will reduce the amount of new testing that will be required. If recent experience from a major testing programme in the USA were to be duplicated in Europe, the number of new animal tests that will need to be undertaken will be significantly lower than the estimates talked about to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is an overall objective, for the UK Government, in negotiating this Regulation, to ensure that animal testing is kept to the minimum necessary to protect human health and the environment. One of the ways we aim to do this is by applying an intelligent approach to testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;1662W&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government welcomes the Commission's efforts to minimise animal testing and recognises that several provisos have been included in the legislative proposal to encourage maximum use of existing data, avoid duplication of testing and use alternative methods wherever appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;" title='Chemicals Regulation' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/chemicals-regulation'></outline>

[189283]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Bradshaw&lt;p&gt;After careful consideration of cormorant population dynamics and modelling I am announcing a new strategy to help fishery owners and angling interests deal with the problems caused by cormorants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A revised licensing system will make it simpler to apply for licences to cull cormorants where serious damage to fisheries can be shown. The new system will presume that where significant numbers of cormorants are present at a site, and it is clear that these are feeding on fish stocks, serious damage is occurring, or there is a risk of serious damage. However this will continue to be confirmed on a case-by-case basis, to ensure that Defra is satisfied that there is no other solution in accordance with the law, and to ensure that there are significant numbers of cormorants feeding which are causing, or are likely to cause, serious damage, Defra will continue its research into non-lethal methods of managing cormorant populations. Further work will be undertaken, in the near future, to test the applicability of fish refuges, optimise their design and to determine their most cost-effective spatial arrangement for them in still waters, as well as looking at ways to resolve problems in rivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The licensing system will be made simpler in the following ways&#x000A;Licences will be:&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Issued for a period of up to two years;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Revoked or amended by Defra as necessary;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Issued between 31 August and 15 April;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Issued in advance to prevent problems occurring;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Issued without an assessor's visit unless it is a new licence application or where circumstances have significantly changed. Every site will be visited at least once every two years, with site visits being undertaken more often if this is considered necessary;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Licences can be amended by telephone, fax or by email&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will also ensure that the Environment Agency and other Defra agencies are aware of the changes and encouraged to follow permitted procedures where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the measures above, where it is necessary to protect salmon and sea trout smolts, we will be prepared to issue licences to kill birds during the smolt run up to 1 May This extension will also apply to&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;1664W&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;protect designated spawning sites, such as gravel shallows on rivers, for appropriate species of fish and fisheries. In addition those sites planning fresh stockings of fish in still waters will be able to obtain licences where such fish would be particularly vulnerable to attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new licensing system is expected to lead to an increase in the number of cormorants culled. Mathematical modelling by the Central Science Laboratory suggests that the overall cormorant population would be reduced but would stabilise at a number significantly higher than its historic level. We will ensure that the cormorant population will be monitored through a refined Wetland Bird Survey count and, if necessary, the number of licences reduced in future years to ensure the stabilisation of the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consequences of the new policy will be assessed on an annual basis and the number of cormorants allowed to be killed under licence adjusted as necessary to ensure stabilisation of the population. Defra will cease to issue licences for a period, and may consider revocation or suspension of licences currently issued, should the cormorant population not respond in the manner predicted. This will provide an added safety mechanism and will protect the conservation status of the bird, (as required under the Birds Directive), while providing enough flexibility to resolve fishery problems.&lt;/p&gt;" title='Cormorant Predation' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/cormorant-predation'></outline>

However, as indicated above, this should not be taken to indicate a causal relationship between the Japanese and other isolates.

[188308]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Morley&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has approved the addition of 17 varieties of GM maize to the EU Common Catalogue of seed varieties. The Common Catalogue is an amalgam of individual member states national seed lists and it is a routine procedure for varieties on individual national seed lists to be added to the Catalogue. These 17 varieties are already on either the national seed lists of France or Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 17 maize varieties all contain the same GM transformation event which confers resistance to the European corn borer. This GM event was given EU wide approval for commercial cultivation in 1998, and maize varieties containing this GM event have been grown in Spain since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While adding these varieties to the EU common catalogue means they could theoretically be grown in the UK it is not expected that any farmer in the UK will attempt to grow them. This is because these varieties are very late maturing and in UK conditions they would not produce a crop with anything like the feed value that livestock farmers require from maize. Nor would they ripen to produce a grain crop. In addition the pest to which the maize varieties are designed to be resistant is not a problem in the UK. We understand that Monsanto do not intend to offer these seed varieties for sale in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;" title='GM Crops' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/gm-crops'></outline>

[187548]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Morley&lt;p&gt;In a report commissioned by Defra it is estimated that in 2000, approximately 660,000 tonnes of methane was emitted from UK landfills, accounting for 27 per cent. of the total methane released from the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of methane that is used has significantly increased over the last five years and information held by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) indicates that there is currently 612,674 KW installed capacity at a total of 269 UK landfill gas power stations. This is out of a potential capacity that could be readily exploited for utilisation of approximately 800,000 KW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proportion of methane in landfill gas that is used has increased in response to two main drivers and is expected to continue to increase. These drivers are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(i) The Landfill Regulations (England and Wales) 2002&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These regulations require landfill operators to collect, treat and use landfill gas (e.g. electricity generation) to the extent possible. The requirements for improved landfill gas management form an important part of new landfill permits being permitted by the Environment Agency in accordance with the Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) regulatory regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(ii) The Renewables Obligation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its revised policy for renewable energy in the UK, the Government introduced the Renewables Obligation for England and Wales. This Obligation requires power suppliers to derive a specified proportion of the electricity they supply to their customers from renewable resources and includes strong financial incentives for suppliers. Landfill gas currently provides approximately one-quarter of the UK&apos;s installed generating capacity for renewable power.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Landfill' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/landfill'></outline>

[187549]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Morley&lt;p&gt;There are no precise figures for the amount of waste cooking fats disposed of or recycled. However, it is estimated that between 70,000 to 90,000 tonnes of used cooking oil is collected each year for use in animal feed. The remainder goes to incineration at energy plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes of used cooking oil going to animal feed comes from catering premises. However, from 1 November 2004, this use will be prohibited under the terms of the Animal By-Products Regulation (Regulation EC No. 1774/2002). It is thought that other markets, including the growing bio-diesel industry, will absorb this stream of used cooking oil. In the short-term, these alternative markets are likely to be elsewhere in the EU. A Cabinet Office sponsored working group, including industry representatives from the various potential markets for used cooking oil, is considering current and potential UK capacity for domestic use of used cooking oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No precise data for the recycling of end of life automotive batteries are currently collected. However, discussions with the battery manufacturing and distributing sector, and the lead recycling industry, suggest that in 2002 and 2003, the UK recycled over 90 per cent. of spent automotive batteries. In each year, an estimated 7.5 million automotive batteries entered&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;1674W&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;the waste stream. In 2002, the UK sold 25,100 tonnes of consumer batteries but only 125 tonnes were collected separately and sent for recycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed forthcoming batteries Directive will ensure that recycling levels for all types of portable battery increase. Collection and recycling targets will have to be met four years from transposition date and the UK will have 18 months to transpose the Directive after it is agreed.

A strategy document was issued to all Prison Service staff in June 2003. This explained the implications for prisons of the changes in the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) due to come into effect on 1 October 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prison estate consists of a wide variety of buildings of differing ages and security levels and therefore access for prisoners to all prisons and prison facilities poses some difficulties. However the Prison Service&apos;s policy for all prisoners is to address their needs, including disability related needs, through the sentence planning process. This will allow prisons to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that prisoners are not discriminated against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Prison Service has significant experience of operating within the employment provisions of the DDA as non-operational staff have had protection since its first introduction. On 1 October, all operational staff will be covered by the DDA. Policies have been revised to ensure that the treatment for individual staff with disabilities is compliant with the employment aspects of the DDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A national disability compliance audit of all Prison Service establishments from a visitors&apos; perspective has not been undertaken. Given the potential scope of the exercise this would not be practicable. It remains the responsibility of each establishment to address the individual requirements of those with particular needs, bearing in mind resource implications and reasonableness. Establishments and Visitors&apos; Centres remain vigilant to the fact that the interpretation of disability within the Disability Discrimination Act is wide.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Disability Discrimination Act' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/disability-discrimination-act'></outline>

The Royal Gibraltar Regiment and military units from the United Kingdom, including the Royal Marines, the Royal Engineers, the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy ships and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary are taking part in a total of more than 20 events throughout the year. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary hopes to attend an event to commemorate the Gibraltar Tercentenary later this year.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Gibraltar' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/gibraltar'></outline>

        <outline id='3578487' text='Mr. Bercow&lt;p&gt;To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what progress his Department is making in seeking to meet the targets of reducing poppy cultivation by 75 per cent. by 2003 and eradicating it completely by 2013. [188361]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Rammell&lt;p&gt;The UK remains committed to supporting the Afghan government in implementing its&lt;image src="S6CV0424P2I0954"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;1705W&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;National Drug Control Strategy, which aims for a 70 per cent. reduction in opium poppy cultivation by 2008, and elimination by 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) will publish its annual report on the level of poppy cultivation in the autumn. We anticipate an increase in cultivation levels. Although unwelcome, experience of counter narcotic policies in Pakistan and Thailand, which both had much lower initial levels of production and were more stable countries, shows that cultivation tends to increase before declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first year of implementation of the strategy, the basic counter narcotics structures have been put in place: drug control legislation, a Counter Narcotics Directorate, the Ministry of Interior&apos;s Afghan Special Narcotics Force, the Counter Narcotics Police and a central eradication capability. Work is also in hand to develop alternative livelihoods for farmers dependent on opium poppy cultivation. These measures provide a sound basis for the future development of robust institutions and programmes to combat opium production and trafficking. Progress remains linked to the wider security situation in Afghanistan and to the implementation of other areas of institution building such as policing and judicial systems.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Poppy Cultivation' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/poppy-cultivation'></outline>

[188966]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hilary Benn&lt;p&gt;Since 1999, the conduct of CDC&apos;s business has been governed by a set of responsible business principles which set out standards for corporate ethics, accountability, environmental and labour practices etc. Equivalent standards are required from CDC&apos;s investee companies. These were monitored by the Business Principles Committee of the CDC board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the reorganisation of CDC, these principles and requirements were reviewed and it was agreed that they should in future also apply to Actis. They have accordingly been written into the Members&apos; Agreement establishing Actis, a copy of which has been placed in the Library. The Business Principles Committee of the Actis Supervisory Board will now oversee their application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business principles are also mandated in CDC&apos;s management contract with Actis and CDC will continue to monitor compliance through the CDC board Business Principles Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gregory Barker&lt;p&gt;To ask the Secretary of State for International Development whether a formal environmental impact assessment was carried out regarding CDC&apos;s Higaturu Oil Palms investment. [188967]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hilary Benn&lt;p&gt;Environmental impact assessments were not the norm when Higaturu was first established in the 1970s. Since then Higaturu has commissioned several environmental studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most recently, in late 2002/early 2003, Higaturu achieved certification to IS014001 for environmental management: this requires that companies have mechanisms in place for identifying potential environmental impacts and their amelioration or avoidance. Such plans are updated twice a year, and include provisions for incorporating stakeholder feedback. The environmental management system is externally audited at least annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S6CV0424P2I0955"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;1707W&lt;/col&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gregory Barker&lt;p&gt;To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will list the environmental concerns relating to CDC/Actis Capital&apos;s Higaturu Oil Palms investment that arose&lt;i&gt;(a)&lt;/i&gt; in the biannual Investment Valuation Review and &lt;i&gt;(b)&lt;/i&gt; via the Business Principles Unit; and if he will list the action plans developed in response. [188969]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hilary Benn&lt;p&gt;CDC&apos;s and Actis&apos; investment reviews are confidential and commercially sensitive.

[188970]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hilary Benn&lt;p&gt;I have received no representations regarding investee environmental regulation exemption requests in Papua New Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the record, CDC does not ask for or receive exemptions on environmental regulations on investments made on its behalf by any of its managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gregory Barker&lt;p&gt;To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will list the monitoring visits at Higaturu Oil Palms since 1999 that CDC/Actis Capital has&lt;i&gt;(a)&lt;/i&gt; directly performed and &lt;i&gt;(b)&lt;/i&gt; independently contracted. [188971]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hilary Benn&lt;p&gt;Monitoring visits commissioned by the Pacific Rim Palm Oil Ltd. (PRPOL) Board have been effectively contracted by CDC as its owner. Since 1999, independent environmental studies have been contracted from at least four expert consultancy firms. There have been two CDC visits focused on environmental issues in 1999 and 2002 as well as a number of general monitoring visits by other CDC staff. There have been two visits by the PRPOL Board including its non-executive directors and by PRPOL&apos;s environmental manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gregory Barker&lt;p&gt;To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will list the criteria for deciding whether CDC/Actis Capital investments are considered of&lt;i&gt;(a)&lt;/i&gt; high, &lt;i&gt;(b)&lt;/i&gt; medium and &lt;i&gt;(c)&lt;/i&gt; low environmental risk; and who performs environmental studies of (i) high, (ii) medium and (iii) low risks. [188972]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hilary Benn&lt;p&gt;CDC&apos;s practice has been to rate investments as high, medium or low environmental risk in accordance with a matrix similar to that used by the International Finance Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High risk activities are those which, due to their type, scale or location have the potential for substantial adverse impact on the environment surrounding the facility and/or globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medium risk activities are those which could cause adverse impacts but these are unlikely to be irreversible or persistent. Remedial measures can more easily be implemented, and the impacts are not as diverse or sensitive as in the high risk category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low risk activities are those which typically have minimal impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;1708W&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;For investments involving high risk to the environment, a formal environmental assessment by an external consultant is required. Where the environmental risk is rated medium, an environmental appraisal by an in-house specialist is required. In investments where the environmental risk is low, a routine environmental appraisal is carried out. Going forward, CDC will require Actis and other fund managers it uses to apply similar procedures and maintain similar standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gregory Barker&lt;p&gt;To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how many CDC/Actis Capital investment projects have been terminated on grounds of&lt;i&gt;(a)&lt;/i&gt; environmental risk and &lt;i&gt;(b)&lt;/i&gt; labour conditions. [188973]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hilary Benn&lt;p&gt;Since 1999, there have been no occasions when environmental risks and/or labour conditions have forced an early exit from an investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gregory Barker&lt;p&gt;To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will list the institutional investors in CDC/Actis Capital by contribution&lt;i&gt;(a)&lt;/i&gt; amount and &lt;i&gt;(b)&lt;/i&gt; proportion.

[189054]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hilary Benn&lt;p&gt;Initial public offerings (IPOs) are a well-established method of attracting private capital. CDC does not seek to influence Actis or other fund managers it may employ in determining the suitability of an IPO in particular cases, whether by sector or any other criterion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gregory Barker&lt;p&gt;To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will list CDC investment programmes aside from Actis Capital.[189055]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hilary Benn&lt;p&gt;In addition to funds managed by Actis, CDC has funds under management with Aureos Capital, a fund specialising in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries.

This is because the benefit is focussed on providing help with the disability-related extra costs of people who are severely disabled early, or relatively early, in life. Help with those costs for people for whom the onset of disability comes with old age is provided by attendance allowance as part of the wide range of support that the Government make available to older people so that they can have a decent and secure income in retirement and share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Disability Living Allowance' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/disability-living-allowance'></outline>

The Bill also protects employees transferring from one employer to another with a minimum level of pension provision. In&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;1746W&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;addition it will encourage individuals to build up pension savings by offering a cash transfer sum when leaving a pension scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through our informed choice agenda we will work with our pension partners to explore and test different approaches aimed at maximising membership of employer-provided schemes. One of these is automatic enrolment where new employees automatically become members of their employer&apos;s pension scheme unless an individual opts out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TUC research does not contain specific information relating to Wales. However, based on the data that is available, Wales does not appear to be significantly different to the rest of the United Kingdom in terms of trends in occupational pensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Best&lt;p&gt;To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the operation of the new direct payment scheme for pensioners; and if he will make a statement. [189134]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Pond&lt;p&gt;Independent research commissioned by DWP which is soon to be published shows that there are very high levels of satisfaction among benefit and pensions customers who have transferred to direct payment and those who have started claiming and chose to receive direct payments. Overall 91 per cent. of customers were happy with the process of setting up direct payments (the figure for pensioners was 88 per cent.). Similarly, overall 93 per cent. of customers were happy with the process of having payments made into an account (the figure for pensioners was 92 per cent.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main benefits of direct payment were seen to be the increased convenience and security. Some people also feel it helps them manage their money more effectively. Most customers felt there were no disadvantages to receiving their benefit or pension by direct payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full research report will be published shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chris Ruane&lt;p&gt;To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what arrangements are being made to ensure that carers with an existing power of attorney may continue to withdraw pensions from the Post Office. [188004]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Pond&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;[holding answer 13 September 2004]:&lt;/i&gt; Payment direct into a bank or building society account including Post Office card account is the normal method of payment for benefits, pensions and allowances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Post Office has arrangements with a wide variety of banks and building societies and depending on the account held, customers including those with power of attorney, are able to withdraw money across the counter at any post office branch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Post Office card account is also available for the payment of pensions but does not support power of attorney. A power of attorney is unable to open a card account in their own name to receive pensions. However they can make use of the DWP appointee procedure to obtain pension as the carer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department is in the process of contacting all customers, including those with an existing power of attorney, who have not provided account details and asking them to do so.

Friend the Chancellor will support the reforms set out in the five year strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Early Years and Children&apos;s Services&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment in early years and childcare will increase &amp;#x00A3;769 million between this year and 2007&amp;#x2013;08. The Government will announce a 10-year childcare strategy in the pre-Budget report when more detailed plans will be published. The broad areas to be covered will include:&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;By 2008, there will be up to 2,500 children&apos;s centres;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Bringing education and childcare together into a single integrated offer for pre-school children; and&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Developing a year round, 8am-6pm, child care offer in many primary schools; with secondary schools offering a range of "things for young people to do".&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment in children&apos;s services will increase by almost &amp;#x00A3;1 billion by 2007&amp;#x2013;08 compared with 2004&amp;#x2013;05. We will use this investment to start taking forward key areas of reforms set out in "Every Child Matters" to achieve better opportunities and outcomes for children, young people and their families. We will provide support in the following areas:&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Increase the information available to parents and carers.&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Ensure that the professionals working with children have the right skills and competencies to support children and their families more effectively.&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Improve support to looked alter children by enhancing the provision of mentoring to this group and improve support to tester carers in order to increase recruitment and retention.&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Improve early identification and protection of vulnerable children by supporting a common assessment framework and developing arrangements for sharing information between agencies to prevent any child slipping through the net.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are committed to rationalising funding streams to local authorities and the voluntary sector and reducing the number of processes. We will discuss with partners how resources can be delivered to ensure funding can be flexibly deployed at the front-line where delivery of services impact most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;154WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Schools&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will increase revenue funding for schools by some &amp;#x00A3;3.5 billion overall between 2005&amp;#x2013;06 and 2007&amp;#x2013;08. That means that we will have increased revenue funding for schools by about &amp;#x00A3;1,300 per pupil or 45 per cent. in real terms in the years since we took office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our twin aims are to make the quality of teaching even better than it is now with schools driving their own and others improvement and to widen opportunities for pupils and teachers through enriching the curriculum. Specific examples of additional investment include:&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;The budget for specialist schools will increase by over &amp;#x00A3;100 million by 2008 to help all schools that meet the standard to become specialist;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;There will be an extra &amp;#x00A3;30 million by 2008 for our leading schools which will be expected to work together with other schools to raise standards everywhere;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;There will be an extra &amp;#x00A3;65 million a year for our primary and secondary strategies that have helped to increase pupil attainment since 1997, with resources targeted on those schools that need the greatest support;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;There will be continuing support for schools in areas served by the "Excellence in Cities Programme" which has helped to improve exam results at a faster rate than the national average;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;We will be making additional resources to the teacher training agency to improve the supply of high quality maths and science teachers and support the professional development of teachers: and&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;To help schools enrich the curriculum, the budget for sport will increase by over &amp;#x00A3;30 million by 2007&amp;#x2013;08 and there will also be more resources for music, modern foreign languages and for partnerships between schools and the arts.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We look forward in the months ahead to discussions with schools and local education authorities on the best way to deliver all the resources that support schools. We will have a new ring-fenced budget for schools from 2006&amp;#x2013;07 and are committed both to delivering three-year budgets for schools and to rationalising the existing funding streams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital investment in schools will increase by &amp;#x00A3;750 million to &amp;#x00A3;6.3 billion by 2007&amp;#x2013;08 including ICT and PFI credits to support further improvements to all schools and allowing every secondary school to he refurbished or rebuilt to a modern standard over the next 10 to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;14&amp;#x2013;19. Further Education (FE) and Skills&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total funding for FE, skills and to develop the 14&amp;#x2013;19 phase will rise by &amp;#x00A3;1.5 billion by 2007&amp;#x2013;08 compared to 2004&amp;#x2013;05, taking the Government&apos;s total expenditure on post-16 (excluding Higher Education (HE) to &amp;#x00A3;11 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a substantial overall investment, building on the increases in funding in the three years up to 2005&amp;#x2013;06, which will allow the sector to meet growth in 16&amp;#x2013;19 participation and enable progress to be sustained on two key agendas: delivering success for all to continue to drive up quality, and reshaping the sector to become more demand led as set out in the Skills Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will provide greater freedom for colleges and training providers through a new delivery structure. This will be based on autonomy and independence for good colleges and providers, backed up by a risk-based approach to lighter touch inspection but tougher sanctions on poor quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S6CV0424P2I0085"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;155WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will enable colleges to engage more effectively with employers by offering the training that they need, and to increase employer and individual co-financing of training in line with the benefits they receive. This is important for the sustainability of the sector and future expansion. We want all colleges to be put on a secure financial footing to deliver the important challenges that we have set out in our five-year strategy. Under the new delivery arrangements, successful colleges will be able to grow and prosper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement includes funding to continue the development of a transformed 14&amp;#x2013;19 phase of education, in the light of the commitments made in the Department&apos;s five-year strategy. The working group on 14&amp;#x2013;19 reform, chaired by Mike Tomlinson, will issue its final report this autumn making proposals for a radical reshaping of the 14&amp;#x2013;19 phase. The Government have set out the five tests that will shape its response to the proposals, but whatever the response, the direction of travel is clear. We are therefore allocating funds to build on the work over the last few years to improve this phase of education, including workforce training and spreading good practice from the 14&amp;#x2013;19 pathfinders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must support colleges in making the transition to a more demand-led approach in which greater funding comes from employers and individuals, because the training they get is designed and delivered in a way that better meets their needs. We will be looking carefully at how we can best do that. As set out in the five-year strategy, we are committed to incorporating the principles of the employer training pilots within mainstream funding for adults, as a way of promoting a more demand-led approach. We will also continue to use the Learning and Skills Council&apos;s (LSC) annual business cycle to allocate public funds in a way that better matches our national skills priorities, including through the new Level 2 entitlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will continue our drive to upgrade facilities in further education and training with an increase of 31 per cent. in capital funding between 2004&amp;#x2013;05 and 2007&amp;#x2013;08. We will also bring local decision-making and allocations for 16&amp;#x2013;19 capital provision into alignment. Working with the Department and other partners, the LSC will establish a single capital budget for new 16&amp;#x2013;19 provision across schools and FE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The achievements of learners depend on the quality of the teaching and learning they receive, and the way in which their teachers and trainers are themselves trained, managed and supported. We will increase by &amp;#x00A3;70 million by 2007&amp;#x2013;08 our investment in initial training and continuous professional development, for teachers, trainers, leaders and managers in colleges, work-based learning and adult and community learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Higher Education (HE)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government expenditure on higher education will increase by around &amp;#x00A3;2 billion between 2004&amp;#x2013;05 and 2007&amp;#x2013;08, taking total investment to almost &amp;#x00A3;9.5 billion. This builds on the significant increases from 2002 spending review, and it confirms our commitment to stand by HE in future spending reviews, made in the White Paper and repeated during the discussions on the HE Bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will increase the HEFCE grant to allow for further increases in student numbers while maintaining the level of student funding per head in real terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;156WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;HE institutions will also benefit from increases in research funding: DfES recurrent funding for research will increase from &amp;#x00A3;1.236 billion in 2005&amp;#x2013;06 to over &amp;#x00A3;1.4 billion in 2007&amp;#x2013;08&amp;#x2014;around 9 per cent., in real terms. Our contribution to total UK science spending, together with the contribution from the Office of Science and Technology, will exceed &amp;#x00A3;5 billion by 2007&amp;#x2013;08.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of all this, HE institutions will receive in full the extra income they generate from charging variable fees&amp;#x2014;in steady state (ie by 2010) this will be around &amp;#x00A3;1.2 billion extra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HE institutions will start to receive this extra income in academic year 2006&amp;#x2013;07. We expect the first tranche to be paid in two instalments&amp;#x2014;one half in early 2007, and the other before the end of the academic year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full time students will benefit from an enhanced student support package:&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;An HE grant of up to &amp;#x00A3;2,700 for the poorest new students;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Enhanced bursaries, paid from HEIs&apos; new fee income stream;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Fee loans from 2006, both for existing and new students;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;A maintenance loan increased to the level of average student expenditure on essential items, both for existing and new students;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Affordable repayments for student loans&amp;#x2014;9 per cent. of salary above &amp;#x00A3;15,000, for all students after April 2005. So students will make a contribution towards the cost of their higher education, but only when they can afford to do so;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;And for new students, a loan write off alter 25 years-that will particularly help those graduates who choose low paid work.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part time students will also benefit from an enhanced package from this autumn. Grants for will replace loans, and a new statutory fee grant will replace the old discretionary scheme. The poorest students will get &amp;#x00A3;825 in grants for fees and course costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this spending review will help to put excellence in HE on a sustainable footing and will secure world-class standards through:&#x000A;&lt;ul&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;increased teaching funding;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;increased research funding;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;increased fee income; and&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;better support for students.&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/ul&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will enable us to make a significant impact on the funding gap we know exists, and to continue expansion on a sensible, properly funded basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Value for money and efficiency&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total investment in education and training is much larger than the figures presented here. Families have always invested and will continue to invest in their children&apos;s care and development. Employers invest in the training and development of their workforce. Support for education-in cash and in kind-is growing. We expect co-funding to grow over the spending review period, as individuals and employers become readier to invest in better education and training that meets their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must ensure that we get maximum value from every pound of additional investment for children and learners. Enabling people across the children, education and skills system to get better value for money from our investment in public services is our aim in the Efficiency Review. We have identified ways to achieve gains in value for money of &amp;#x00A3;4.3 billion over the Spending Review period. For example, we will&#x000A;&lt;image src="S6CV0424P2I0086"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;157WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;reduce the number of civil service posts in the DIES and OFSTED by 1,960;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;enable front-line professionals in schools, colleges and higher education institutions to use their time more productively, enabling institutions to achieve more with their resources; for example through workforce reform, investment in ICT and reducing administrative burdens;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;improve procurement of goods, services and new school building, using a new Procurement Centre of Excellence to strengthen procurement practice across the education and children&apos;s services sectors:&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;streamline the delivery system for each sector through improvements in policy, funding and regulation, such as the lighter touch process for OFSTED inspection, streamlined data collection and reduced reporting and monitoring requirements introduced in the New Relationship with Schools.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this statement sets out how we will use the additional resources for children and learners over the next three years to deliver the ambitious programme set out in the five-year strategy. I will be vigilant in ensuring that they are used efficiently and effectively. If resources are not being used to best effect. I will not hesitate to ensure they are switched to where they are most needed, and I will inform Parliament of any significant movements.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Resources for Children and Learners' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/resources-for-children-and-learners'></outline>

      <outline id='3578192' text='The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration (Mr. Desmond Browne)&lt;p&gt;A key element in the Government&apos;s strategy to speed up the processing of asylum claims has been the introduction of the fast track asylum processes operated initially at the Oakington reception centre and now also at Harmondsworth removal centre and other locations. The use of detention to fast track suitable claims under these processes is necessary to achieve the objective of delivering decisions quickly. This ensures, among other things, that those whose claims can be quickly decided can be removed as quickly as possible in the event that the claim is unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawfulness of detaining asylum claimants for the sole purpose of deciding their claims quickly was upheld by the Court of Appeal and by the House of Lords in the case of Saadi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we began the fast track process we said that it was our intention to detain asylum claimants suitable for a quick decision for a period of about seven to 10 days. If we could not decide the claim within that time scale, the claimant would be released or moved to another place of detention with the facilities to support people detained for longer periods. In the vast majority of cases, we have been able to do exactly that. However, the need to ensure a really sharp focus on quality decision making, including for example in non-suspensive appeal (NSA) cases the need for a second pair of eyes, means we cannot always make decisions and serve them on claimants within the original seven to 10 target time scale. While we are able to do this in over 95 per cent. of non-NSA Oakington claims, our experience has shown us that NSA claims take slightly longer, with the majority of decisions being made and&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;158WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;served within 14 days. The purpose of this announcement is to set out our revised fast track process detention policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fast track process has scheduled days set aside for specific activities (interviewing, serving the decision etc. but we intend this to be a guide as to how the process will generally operate. There will always be occasions when for operational or other reasons it is not possible to undertake certain activities. This may be because the claimant is temporarily unwell, there is an interpreter problem, the claimant requires longer to obtain further evidence or wishes to submit late representations for example. The process must be flexible enough to accommodate such circumstances. We would not necessarily release people from detention or from the process or move them to another place of detention simply because the timetable cannot be adhered to, if the indications are that we can make and serve a decision within a reasonable time-scale. However, the period of detention for making a quick decision will not be allowed to continue for longer than is reasonable in all the circumstances. We will aim to make decisions within 10 to 14 days, but there will be occasions where it is quicker&amp;#x2014;for example, at Harmondsworth or a non-NSA decision at Oakington. However, we will continue to detain for the purpose of deciding the claim quickly, even beyond the 10 to 14 day time scale, unless the length of time before a decision can be made looks like it will be longer than is reasonable in all the circumstances. Continued detention may also be merited in some cases irrespective of decision time scale, where our general detention criteria apply. We may also detain claimants after we have made and served a decision in accordance with our general detention criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applicants with dependants may be detained for the purposes of making a quick decision on their claim, but there may be operational constraints on who can be detained from time to time. For example, the acceptance of families or pregnant females into Oakington may be halted temporarily if there is an illness circulating which might be harmful to them&amp;#x2014;chicken pox for example. The criteria for acceptance are applied equally to those entering the Oakington and Harmondsworth processes. The principal difference is that at Oakington, individuals with dependants on their asylum claims can be detained at the centre and at Harmondsworth they cannot. Separating dependants on a claim from the claimant can present operational difficulties and for that reason and the fact that it has no female or family accommodation, Harmondsworth will, in general, only accept male claimants who have no dependants on their claims. That is not to say that, at Oakington or Harmondsworth or any other location where fast tracking is carried out, we will never detain a claimant who has dependants on their claim, even where it is not possible to detain the dependants with the claimant. There may be occasions when we believe it is necessary and right so to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When deciding whom to accept into fast track processes, account is taken of any particular individual circumstances known to us, which might make the claim particularly complex, or unlikely to be resolved in the time scales, however flexibly applied. The existence of UK based family ties&amp;#x2014;such as a spouse, partner or child&amp;#x2014;would not automatically exclude a claimant&#x000A;&lt;image src="S6CV0424P2I0087"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;159WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;from the process as some issues, such as article 8 family life ones, can be relatively easy to decide quickly given the case law and the individual&apos;s actual circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will continually review how our fast track processes are operating, the criteria for acceptance into them and the indicative process time scales we aim for. This will apply equally to those we are presently operating and to any we may seek to introduce as part of our overall strategy of speeding up the asylum process and making it more effective.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Fast Track Asylum and Detention Policy' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/fast-track-asylum-and-detention-policy'></outline>

They are: the appropriateness of the sentence Joseph received; the effectiveness of relevant operational procedures in identifying, placing and safeguarding vulnerable young people in custody; and whether the juvenile secure estate has adequate accommodation to meet the needs of vulnerable young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The steps I am taking to deal with these are as follows:&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;I have referred the circumstances in which Joseph received a custodial sentence on three counts of attempted robbery to the Sentencing Guidelines Council, requesting it to take this case into account in its current work to draw up guidelines on sentencing for robbery;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;I have appointed David Lambert, a former Assistant Chief Inspector of the Social Services Inspectorate, to examine the operational issues raised by this case, including through the coroner's inquest. I have also asked him to provide a summary account of all investigations that have been conducted into Joseph's death;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;I have asked the Youth Justice Board, which is preparing proposals for its vision for the future juvenile custodial estate, to take full account of the points made by the coroner on the adequacy of custodial provision for vulnerable young offenders.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I consider that the above measures are the most effective means of addressing the matters the coroner has drawn to the Home Secretary's attention and what lessons should be learned from Joseph's death. I am grateful to the coroner, and to Joseph's family, for highlighting the issues that are of concern to them.

Correcting for these errors meant that the correct figure for the increase in Green Belt in England between 1997 and 2003 should have been around 19,000 hectares and not the 25,000 figure published in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I apologised to the House for these errors during the town planning debate on 26 May and said that I had publicised the 19,000 hectares figure in my reply on 10 May to a parliamentary question from the hon.

      <outline id='3578202' text='The Minister for Housing and Planning (Keith Hill)&lt;p&gt;In my statement to the House of Commons on 20 January 2004,&lt;i&gt;Official Report,&lt;/i&gt; column 55WS, on publication of "The Planning Service: Costs and Fees", I said that that research would be followed up with full consultation on bringing further resource into the planning service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have today issued a consultation document. "Changes to the System of Planning Fees in England". This sets out in detail our proposals to improve the resourcing of planning so that it can deliver better services to the community and to business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;162WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposals include raising planning fees by an average of 17 per cent. This is intended to help authorities recover more of the costs of handling planning applications. In many cases, especially for the larger applications, the current fee falls far short of the handling costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increases are designed to fall differentially on applicants. For example a small business which acquired a new property and needed to apply for a change of use permission would see a fee increase from &amp;#x00A3;220 to &amp;#x00A3;240. Major developers and larger applicants will be asked to pay more&amp;#x2014;the maximum fee for a major development will rise from &amp;#x00A3;11,000 to &amp;#x00A3;28,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am also consulting on the introduction of a performance relationship, the first time this has happened in relation to fees increases. Those authorities that meet Government targets for handling major applications will be allowed to increase the application fee they charge by up to 10 per cent. to help them meet more of the costs of handling these large and often complex applications. This will encourage authorities to work harder to meet our targets. Authorities that offer the facility for applications to be made online will also have the option to reduce those fees to encourage the submission of online applications and greater efficiency in the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, the proposed increases are expected to raise around &amp;#x00A3;30 million for the planning service. Next year we will also be considering the need to look at widening the scope of planning fees, and the need for further regular increases in fees to ensure that costs in providing a planning service are being fully covered. In the meantime, I consider that the rises proposed are a sensible increase, which together with the continuing planning delivery grant, is helping to provide sustained and much-needed resource to improve planning services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document is available on the ODPM website copies are also available in the Libraries of both Houses.

      <outline id='3578207' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Ivor Caplin)&lt;p&gt;During defence questions on 19 July 2004, I gave an undertaking to the House to&lt;image src="S6CV0424P2I0089"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;163WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;make a statement about progress made during the summer in the issuing of the Canal zone medal to Suez veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As at the week ending 10 September 2004, 41,314 applications had been received and acknowledged, and 14,761 medals dispatched. The Royal Navy is now assessing applications as they are received (5 February 2004 as at 19 July 2004), the Royal Air Force is assessing applications received on 30 December 2003 (26 November as at 19 July), and although the army medal office is still assessing applications from 31 October 2003, this is due to some 4,300 applications being received during that week. This peak in applications, which occurred following my statement to the House on 23 October, is nearly cleared and the assessment of applications received during November will begin very shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this significant army backlog remains, a number of measures implemented by the joint personnel administration team responsible for setting up the MOD medal office at RAF Innsworth are already bringing tangible benefits. A new medal laser engraving facility has recently been installed at Innsworth. This is currently being used solely to engrave Iraq medals and over 6,000 have been produced during its first four weeks of operation. This has allowed the engraving facility at the army medal office to concentrate its efforts on the Suez Canal zone medal and as a result, the engraving backlog of some 1,800 medals has been cleared during the last month. Improvements to the information systems used by the army medal office, the facility to work overtime and the diversion of staff to Suez Canal zone medal processing are helping to improve matters further. These measures, coupled with the concerted efforts of army medal office staff have brought about an increase of approximately 30 per cent. in the army assessment rate during recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increase in output has resulted in an average of some one hundred and twenty more applications per week being assessed since July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can also announce that with effect from 1 October 2004 the armed forces personnel administration agency will assume full responsibility for the management of medal output, target setting and performance monitoring. This will allow many of the benefits of a single MOD medal office, such as common procedures based on single Service best practice, to be introduced prior to its actual formation date next spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following these initial changes, I now anticipate that the backlog should be cleared by January 2006 and I hope this can continue to be improved upon. I should like to pay tribute to the staff of the single service medal offices for their part in bringing about this improvement.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Suez Canal Zone Medal/Ministry of Defence Medal Office' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/suez-canal-zone-medalministry-of-defence'></outline>

      <outline id='3578210' text='The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Mr. Adam Ingram)&lt;p&gt;Following extensive work to identify the best way forward for military aircraft support, I am announcing today my preferred option, subject to trades union consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2003 the Ministry of Defence undertook an end-to-end review of the logistics process from the front line to industry. This review, the results of which I announced on 10 September 2003, concluded that there was a need, and substantial scope, for improvement in all areas of military air systems support&amp;#x2014;in industry, the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) and the services front line commands alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review recommended that on-aircraft depth support&amp;#x2014;deep repair, scheduled maintenance and modification of aircraft&amp;#x2014;could best be rationalised by concentrating at main operating bases (MOBs), and that this conclusion should be tested in an investment appraisal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment appraisal identified three broad options&amp;#x2014;to concentrate forward support of certain air platforms to MOBs, to concentrate backwards the same platforms to Defence Aviation Repair Agency (DARA) sites and where appropriate industry sites, or a hybrid solution with some platforms concentrated forward and others back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order not to prejudice the in-service date of the upgraded Harrier GR9 of 2006, I have already announced that Harrier support will concentrate forward to the MOB at RAF Cottesmore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wider investment appraisal and subsequent affordability analysis has demonstrated that concentrating support of the Tornado GR4 aircraft forward at the MOB at RAF Marham would provide best value for money compared with the alternative of concentrating backward on the DARA site at St. Athan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the work has demonstrated that it would not be cost-effective to concentrate the Tornado F3 aircraft either forward or back, given that it will soon be replaced by Typhoon. The work has also shown that it would provide better value for money to concentrate depth support for Lynx, Chinook and Sea King back to DARA Fleetlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My preferred way ahead is consistent with the announcement made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence on 21 July this year, which set out the need for the armed forces and their associated support functions to evolve in order to meet the demands of a changing world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The streamlining of our logistic and support functions, such as those which flow from the end-to-end logistics review, will help the Department meet its targets under the efficiency review. In conjunction with&#x000A;&lt;image src="S6CV0424P2I0090"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;165WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;the &amp;#x00A3;3.7 billion increase to the defence budget, it will enable us to continue to modernise our armed forces, tailoring our military capability to meet the challenges of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our preferred way forward has implications for our military and civilian work-force, as well as for our partners in industry who undertake depth support of military aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concentrating support for rotary aircraft at DARA Fleetlands offers the opportunity to exploit fully the economies of scale that may be achieved by collocating these platforms at a single centre. Sufficient defence work would remain at DARA St. Athan to enable continued operations there until 2008&amp;#x2013;09.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will explore with other Government Departments alternative options for St. Athan after 2009, although the migration of work and the withdrawal from service of some platforms means that 500 redundancies would be needed there in 2005. In the longer term, failure to win alternative work would result in the closure of St. Athan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application of end-to-end principles will ensure that the MOD works smarter and will improve efficiency by adopting modern best practice in supporting our military aircraft. It will lead to reductions of some 1,500 RAF uniformed personnel, which form part of the overall reductions of 7,500 set out in the 21 July announcement on force structure changes and defence change and modernisation programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There would also be modest reductions in MOD civilian posts and contractor staff posts at RAF Lossiemouth, RAF St. Mawgan and Wattisham and RNAS Yeovilton. Other service personnel would be transferred to the new depth support locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A formal consultation period of 30 working days will now begin with the trades unions.

      <outline id='3578213' text='The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Patricia Hewitt)&lt;p&gt;The performance and innovation unit report on modernising the post office network, published in June 2000, recommended that the Government should support the rural network in the first instance to 2006. It also recommended that the postal services commission, Postcomm, should advise the Government on options for the rural network after 2006. I have received that advice and have considered it very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are fully committed to supporting the Post Office&apos;s strategy for creating a viable and vibrant post office network that meets changing customer needs, providing reasonable access to services in rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My hon. Friend the then Minister of State for Energy, E-Commerce and Postal Services announced in the House on 2 December 2002 the Government&apos;s decision to make &amp;#x00A3;450 million available to support the rural post&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;166WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;office network through from 2003 to 2006. That three-year package was intended as a transitional measure, designed to help rural post offices through the changes in the network&apos;s business between 2003 and 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point in the transition rural post offices continue to face real challenges and a large part of the rural network continues to be unsustainable commercially. For many post offices the number of customers they serve is simply too small to make the business attractive or sustainable. With the prospect of customer numbers continuing to fall as people access services in different ways it is clear that there are challenges ahead and that new ways to deliver services more efficiently and effectively are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How and where people access services is changing. It is not clear that the present network best meets those changing needs, or whether because of that the current shape and scale of the rural network is a viable long-term prospect. A solution for the longer-term will need to take these changes fully into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this background Postcomm has advised the Government to review the reasons for and nature of our support of the rural network in the longer term. They advise that the nature of that support may need to change substantially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postcomm&apos;s advice recognises that such changes must be well informed and that further work will be necessary. Pilot activity by the Post Office, funded by the Government, to test new ways of ensuring access to post office services in rural areas is under-way. The lessons that will emerge from these trials over the next 12 to 18 months will be crucial in informing longer-term decisions about the future shape of the rural post office network. At this stage it is simply too early to draw conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government have, therefore, concluded that now is not the right time to take decisions about the long-term future of the rural network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, however, vital that we continue to support the network through this continuing difficult period. The Government are committed to ensuring reasonable access for rural communities to postal and other services. It is also clear from Postcomm&apos;s advice to us that without Government funding much of the current rural network would face closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am, therefore, pleased to announce that the Government have decided, subject to securing any further necessary state aid clearance from the European Commission, to extend its transitional financial facility for rural post offices for two further years from 2006 until 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will make available up to a maximum of &amp;#x00A3;150 million a year until 2008 to enable Post Office Ltd. to continue to meet the cost of maintaining the non-commercial part of the rural post office network and to pilot new ways of delivering services. Pilot activity is a key element of the current funding package&amp;#x2014;we have already allocated &amp;#x00A3;25 million to fund pilots. Our intention is that this will continue to be a key element of the package going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S6CV0424P2I0091"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;167WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funding will ensure that Post Office Ltd. will have money to test new ways of delivering services and will not be forced to close unprofitable rural post offices because of a lack of funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current funding is from the gilts&amp;#x2014;Government money previously received as dividends from the company and made available back to the company for certain specific uses&amp;#x2014;and it is our intention that the further funding to April 2008 will also come from these gilts. The detailed mechanism, sums of money and timing of payments will be subject to further detailed discussion with the company, as well as being subject to state aid clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PIU report recommended that the Post Office should be required to prevent avoidable closures of rural post offices, in the first instance to 2006. Postcomm has advised us that it is concerned that this policy can lead to post offices being saved or reopened where it is clear that customer numbers have dwindled to levels far below what is sustainable. Furthermore they have recommended that this policy should not be extended beyond April 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government&apos;s direction to Post Office Ltd. to maintain the network and do all they can to prevent avoidable closures remains in place. There is no question of them being able to initiate the closure of offices. However, in response to Postcomm&apos;s immediate concern I propose to amend the definition of what is unavoidable so that when Post Office Ltd. is responding to a closure&amp;#x2014;for example when a sub-postmaster decides to retire&amp;#x2014;it takes into account circumstances where there is no prospect of a viable future for a post office because of a collapse in demand for services in a particular location. The intention will be to ensure that Post Office Ltd. is focused on maintaining access to services in rural areas fully taking into account local circumstances. These changes, yet to be worked up in detail, will be published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that we will be better placed to take a decision on the longer-term future of the rural network, including whether the current policy on avoidable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x000A;&lt;table type="span"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;Applicant/Production Unit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;Project Description&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Period 1 Award&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Period 2 CIA Sought&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Period 2 Award&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tonnes Secured Mt&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jobs Secured/Created&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Eckington Colliery Partnerships, S Yorks&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Extension of main drift to access two new areas of reserves; acquisition of coal handling and other equipment&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&amp;#x00A3;0.063m&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&amp;#x00A3;0.014m&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;&amp;#x00A3;0.014m&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.3&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td align="right"&gt;25/6&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Energybuild, Aberpergwm, S Glamorgan&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Recovery of cross-measure drifts to access reserves through fault; upgrade of coal preparation plant &amp;amp; surface/admin facilities.

      <outline id='3578218' text='The Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn)&lt;p&gt;On 14 September 2004, I provided the House with an oral statement on the impact that Hurricane Ivan was having on a number of islands in the Caribbean. I would like to update the House today, in advance of the recess, on the latest situation and the international relief effort being undertaken. I will provide a further written statement following the return of the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hurricane Ivan has now passed through the Caribbean and is in the gulf of Mexico. It was downgraded to a category four hurricane and made landfall along the United States coast on 15 September. It took one week, from 7 to 14 September, for the hurricane to travel from Grenada, to Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and finally western Cuba, causing over 60 deaths and severe damage along its way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation in Grenada continues to be serious. The latest reports from the island indicate that 37 people died and over 300 were injured as a result of the hurricane. Two thirds of the population (60,000 people) are reportedly affected and it is estimated that between 4,000 and 8,000 people are living in shelters. The range of figures reflects that many of these shelters are private houses of which there are up to 200. Electricity supply continues to be a problem and piped water is only available to about a third of households across the island. In the meantime water tankers are operating, but fuel is in short supply. This is hampering both transport and emergency electricity generation. The main hospital is working and sustained only minor damage. Drugs are in short supply as the main stock was destroyed. Other hospitals on the island suffered more extensive damage. There is a dawn to dusk curfew following the looting that occurred immediately after the hurricane had hit the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;170WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relief operation is scaling up quickly but continues to face problems with coordination and communications. The emergency operation centre building was destroyed in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane but was brought back into operation by the efforts of HMS Richmond. It is now fully operational with assistance from the regional Caribbean disaster emergency response agency and a recently arrived United Nations disaster assessment and coordination team. Roads and airports are now open. Distribution of food and other relief items is proceeding slowly, in part due to fuel shortage and in part due to the scale of properly assessing where need is greatest. The United Nations team will help in prioritising the delivery of supplies. Communicating with the population is also a constraint. There are only FM broadcasts operational, and these do not reach the whole island. The two dependencies of Carriacou and Petit Martinique have yet to be assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I reported to the House on 14 September, the Department for International Development delivered plastic sheeting for 1,400 families and water containers for 11,000 people on 11 September and made an immediate contribution of some &amp;#x00A3;83,000 to the Pan American Health Organisation. We have since made a contribution of &amp;#x00A3;132,000 to the preliminary appeal for Grenada of the International Federation of the Red Cross. The Pan American Health Organisation and the International Federation of the Red Cross are both active in Grenada. The Pan American Health Organisation has deployed medical personnel and vaccines. The International Federation of the Red Cross has sent a number of relief flights with basic relief items, including shelter materials. The Department for International Development are continuing to monitor the situation closely, in particular the level of medical supplies on the island, and will consider providing further relief assistance as needs become clearer. We are in daily contact with the Pan American Health Organisation concerning health needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S6CV0424P2I0093"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;171WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States Agency for International Development has provided plastic sheeting for 25,000 people and other relief items in Grenada. The Canadian International Development Agency have approved support of &amp;#x00A3;211,100 and the European Community&apos;s humanitarian office have approved an allocation of &amp;#x00A3;1.03 million for Grenada. The bulk of this allocation will go towards the Red Cross operation and Oxfam who are assisting with emergency water and sanitation work. The United Kingdom&apos;s share of this European Community support is about &amp;#x00A3;200,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two-person humanitarian assessment team sent to the region by the Department for International Development arrived in Kingston, Jamaica on 13 September. On 14 September, they met with representatives from the Government of Jamaica, national and international organizations, and other donors. They report good coordination between the Government&apos;s Office for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, the Jamaican Red Cross, the Salvation Army and the United Nations disaster assistance and coordination team. Joint rapid assessments are underway with several areas of the island already identified as the most severely affected. These areas include Westmoreland, Claredon, Morant Bay, May Penn and the northeast Blue Mountains. It is not thought that there is widespread devastation but there are a number of pockets of devastation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until the assessments are completed, exact figures are difficult to come by but there are reported to be 200 to 245 shelters open, serving between 4,000 to 13,000 residents across the island. Water is the key issue in many of the hardest hit communities. Food stocks in the Blue Mountain region were reported as running low. Heavy flooding in the surrounding area is delaying assessments. As an interim measure, the Government of Jamaica through its defence forces has airlifted an initial stock of food to the region. The Red Cross has also delivered relief supplies. Although most of the hospitals are operational, they report a lack of power and water supplies with much of the ground water contaminated. The Pan American Health Organization is working with the Ministry of Health to identify specific needs in the health sector and resolve these problems. A number of non-governmental organisations have undertaken preliminary assessments to address short-term relief needs. The Department for International Development has received requests for funding support from Save the Children, Oxfam and ADRA. These proposals are being urgently considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for International Development assessment team arrived on the Cayman Islands, from Jamaica on 15 September. They are assisting the Government in undertaking urgent humanitarian needs assessments, which will determine what further urgent supplies are required. Initial estimates indicate 15&amp;#x2013;20 per cent. of residential houses completely destroyed and 20 per cent. with major damage. The Department for International Development had already responded to an earlier request for assistance by procuring 3 million water purification tablets, 50 chainsaws, 500 camp cots for children and 5,000 pieces of plastic sheeting. These supplies are on their way to the island, with our first relief flight arriving today. The International Federation of the Red Cross is also planning a relief flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;172WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Governor is concerned about maintaining security on the islands and is looking to obtain additional security support. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is considering the request. The Governor is not aware of medical supply problems but the assessment being undertaken will confirm these and other needs. The main concern appears to be water supply and the need to deliver water purification tablets, which the Department for International Development is supplying. A water trucking system is being set up. HMS Richmond sent a 17-person party on shore on 14 September. They have repaired generators, attended to damaged buildings and have been providing food distributions. Of a population of 42,000, approximately 3,000 people remain in shelters. Food supplies are being delivered to all shelters. The airport on the island is now fully operational and busy with both passenger and cargo aircraft. This has enabled 30 dialysis patients needing emergency dialysis and ongoing care to be airlifted to the United States by Cayman Airways. Shops have reopened. The Caribbean Utilities Company will support restoration of power supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivan swung past the western edge of Cuba late on 13 September as a category five hurricane. One and a half million people had been evacuated from the area by the Cuban authorities, with 300,000 people placed in shelters. The western area of Cuba is sparsely populated and there have been no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or serious damage to buildings. It is mainly a tobacco growing area but planting does not begin till next month so limited damage is expected on tobacco crops. Its impact on agricultural installations and housing in coastal areas is to be reported. Airports have reopened and children are expected to return to school this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation are forming an assessment team to inform the Government of needs. Cuba prepared itself well ahead of the hurricane and fortunately appears to have been spared the full force of the hurricane, and national emergency services have mobilised rapidly to distribute food and non-food items to displaced people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst Hurricane Ivan has passed out of the Caribbean, hurricane warnings remain in place for the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. Residents and tourists have been evacuated from areas likely to be affected by strong winds and waves. No reports are yet available on the impact on the Yucatan peninsula but damage is likely to be contained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on the continuing relief effort to affected islands will be made available via the Department for International Development website &lt;u&gt;http://www.dfid.gov ulc/.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will include details of how concerned members of the public could help via relief agencies.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Hurricane Ivan' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/hurricane-ivan'></outline>
      <outline id='3578219' text='The Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn)&lt;p&gt;I visited Baghdad and Basra from 31 August to 1 September to learn for myself about progress with reconstruction on the ground. I met Prime Minister Allawi, development Ministers, representatives from the United Nations, civil society and the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq, and representatives from local government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S6CV0424P2I0094"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;173WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interim Iraqi Government is now clearly in charge, although recent events in Najaf have dominated its first months in power. The difficult security situation has inevitably slowed down the reconstruction effort of not just the UK, but also of other donors and the multilateral agencies. However, it was clear that progress is still being made. Some 45 km of water pipes have been laid in Basra since my last visit in February and electricity distribution is now more equitable across the national grid. Partially due to these efforts, the riots that happened in Basra last summer because of the lack of basic services have not reoccurred this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in Iraq I announced a number of new UK bilateral projects, focusing on building the capacity of the Iraqi Administration, and promoting employment creation, in southern Iraq. These projects mark an important step forward in our reconstruction efforts in southern Iraq as we move from meeting short-term humanitarian and immediate infrastructure rehabilitation needs towards addressing longer-term development challenges. Southern Iraq should receive massive reconstruction funds over next two to three years from a range of sources, including the USA, Japan and the World Bank and UN trust funds. One of DFID&apos;s aims is to help the Iraqi administration to ensure that this money is spent quickly and well, and that the benefits of reconstruction are widely shared across the population. We are investing &amp;#x00A3;20.5 million in strengthening local management, planning and financial capacity in the four southern governorates of Basra, Muthanna, Dhi Qar and Maysan, including &amp;#x00A3;15 million for projects developed by the Governorates. We have also started a new &amp;#x00A3;16.5 million programme to finance employment programmes and further emergency infrastructure repairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DFID has committed &amp;#x00A3;331 million to humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in Iraq since March 2003. Of this total &amp;#x00A3;78 million has been allocated to bilateral reconstruction projects in southern Iraq; &amp;#x00A3;19 million to support for the new interim Iraqi Government, the justice sector, independent media, civil society and political participation; and &amp;#x00A3;28 million for consultants and secondments to the Coalition Provisional Authority while it was in office up to 28 June. &amp;#x00A3;70 million has been paid into the trust funds managed by the United Nations and the World Bank, to be spent primarily on health, education, water and sanitation projects, assistance for refugees and strengthening governance; and nearly &amp;#x00A3;12 million has been committed to IMF and international finance corporation programmes for economic governance support and small business development. Updates on DFID&apos;s programmes can be found on the internet at &lt;u&gt;www.dfid.gov.uk,&lt;/u&gt; as well as in the House Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As on my previous two visits to Iraq, I was impressed by the extraordinary courage and commitment of all the people, both international and Iraqi, who are working to help the new Iraqi Government and the people of Iraq to build the better future that they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Iraq (Reconstruction)' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/iraq-reconstruction'></outline>

In recent years, the United Kingdom, with the international community, has been increasingly involved in helping countries to stabilise after conflict. We need to deal better with conflict and instability, learn lessons and improve our capability to respond. Within this broader context, there is particular scope to improve the way in which we deal with immediate post conflict situations, especially those which include military and civilian components. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Ministry of Defence and Department for International Development are working closely to develop the capabilities that are needed. The Foreign Secretary will chair a new Cabinet sub-committee on post conflict reconstruction. My right hon. Friends and I expect to be in a position formally to establish an inter-departmental post conflict reconstruction unit later this year to lead this work. It will have a policy and operational role. In spring 2005 we anticipate being able to inform Parliament about its initial capabilities. Meanwhile, my right hon.

In the case of Pakistan, the loan concerned was to the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only other inter-governmental debt between the UK and Pakistan relates to export credit guarantees. Following the Paris Club Agreement, this debt was rescheduled and is now valued at only &amp;#x00A3;9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001 DFID agreed to cancel the ex-CDC debt, subject to Pakistan completing the second review of the Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) with the International Monetary Fund. In the interim, the debt was suspended with no interest payments required from Pakistan to DFID. On 23 June 2004 the IMF Executive Board successfully completed the second annual review of Pakistan&apos;s PRGF, implying the ex-CDC debt can now be cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan programme continues to be a high priority for DFID. As announced to the House in March 2003, during 2003 DFID provided Pakistan with &amp;#x00A3;55 million to cancel debt held with the Asian Development Bank, World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Over the next two years (2004&amp;#x2013;05 and 2005&amp;#x2013;06), DFID&apos;s assistance to Pakistan will be &amp;#x00A3;70 and &amp;#x00A3;74 million respectively.

accurately and as such is committed to reviewing each application on its own merits. The process involved in undertaking an in-depth review involves contact with many health and social care organisations and bodies, and as such there have been considerable delays in obtaining all the relevant records and patient data. In some cases data and information from aged cases has been lost and, wherever possible, it must be gathered from alternative sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delays should not automatically be attributed to the SHAs involved in particular cases; occasionally it is the claimant themselves who are responsible for the delay. Many SHAs are now exceeding 95 per cent. completion. In some cases, however, progress has been unsatisfactory, and the Department will take up the matter directly with those SHAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, almost 20 per cent. of cases have been granted recompense. As stated previously, the NHS expects to pay a total of &amp;#x00A3;180 million when all the cases received by the end of March 2004 have been completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 1,600 cases remain outstanding, which is unacceptable. However, I am assured that all cases relating to living people have been prioritised, and that new applications for NHS continuing care are being dealt with in a timely fashion. My Department will be liaising with all SHAs to ensure appropriate procedures are now in place and that outstanding cases are resolved as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proportion of completed cases by SHA is shown in the table.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Continuing Care' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/continuing-care'></outline>

      <outline id='3578232' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Mr. Chris Pond)&lt;p&gt;On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the benefit fraud inspectorate (BFI) inspection report on Liverpool city council was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the housing Green paper "Quality and Choice: A Decent Home for All", published in April 2000, the Department for Work and Pensions developed a performance framework for housing benefits. The "Performance Standards for Housing Benefits" allow local authorities to make a comprehensive self-assessment of whether they deliver benefit effectively&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;178WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;and securely. They are the standards that the Department for Work and Pensions expects local authorities to aspire to and achieve in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2002&amp;#x2013;03, Liverpool city council administered some &amp;#x00A3;237.1 million in housing benefits, 21.69 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BFI inspected Liverpool city council in July 2000 and identified significant weaknesses in its provision and management of benefit and counter fraud services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second inspection report finds that since July 2000 the council had initiated a major business transformation programme to address the issues and recommendations in BFI&apos;s first report. These included the:&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;re-engineering of its business processes;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;establishment of a joint venture with a major private contractor to provide essential business services to improve its benefits and counter fraud services, including a customer contact centre and one stop shops;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;implementation of a document management system in January 2003;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;full implementation of the verification framework in April 2003;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;replacement of its benefits and council tax IT systems in October 2003.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report finds that the council had a clear vision for its benefits service supported by policies covering the full range of benefit administration activities. However, IT problems led to a backlog of work and the council had consistently failed to meet best value performance indicators for speed of processing claims. Delays in processing claims were undermining most aspects of the benefits service. New claim customers had to wait an average of 143 days for a claim to be processed and delays in processing reported changes of circumstances had resulted in overpayments being incurred unnecessarily by the council, representing a loss of public funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BFI had serious concerns about the total level of overpayment debt at the council, and an estimated &amp;#x00A3;3.5 million of outstanding debt had not been transferred from its old benefits IT system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BFI commend internal audit for its support of the benefits management team in addressing areas of weakness identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The counter fraud service was very effective and made use of the full range of sanctions available. The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to further improve the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit, as well as counter-fraud activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My right hon.

He also announced that, as part of their programme to modernise benefit processing and contact centre operations, Jobcentre Plus will take on six pensions centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can today announce that:&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Subject to further detailed planning benefit processing will be centralised in 81 sites by 2008. I would like to make it clear that 37 sites will cease to be viable and will close altogether as a direct consequence of centralisation. Not all jobs will go with many transferring elsewhere. In those sites not named for closure there is continued Jobcentre Plus activity and their future will be determined in the normal way as part of the rollout of the Jobcentre Plus network.&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;As part of the Jobcentre Plus roll-out strategy Jobcentre Plus Direct (which provides an initial telephone contact service for customers) will deliver services through 23 contact centres by 2006. This will involve moving work from a number of existing locations within the Jobcentre Plus network and will result in the closure of three sites where contact centre work is currently undertaken; Provan, Banbury and Milton Keynes.&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;In line with the Lyons Review, which recommended relocating some public sector activities away from London and the South East, Employer Services Direct will close two of its 11 Employer Direct sites, in Portsmouth and Bromley, by Summer 2005. Work will be moved to other sites.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff in all affected sites are being briefed by their managers today. We continue to consult with the trade unions. We have already outlined to them our policy proposals for handling these changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes I am announcing today are the latest component of our continuing modernisation programme that will lead to more efficient and effective services for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x000A;&lt;table&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td colspan="3" align="center"&gt;Benefits centralisation sites&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;Region&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;Processing sites&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;Site closures&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;East of Engalnd&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Basildon, Great Oaks House&lt;lb/&gt; Bury St. Edmunds, St.&lt;lb/&gt; Andrews House&lt;lb/&gt; Luton, Cheviot House&lt;lb/&gt; Norwich, Baltic House&lt;lb/&gt;&#x000A;Peterborough, Clifton House&lt;lb/&gt; Watford, Exchange House&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Braintree, Panfield Lane&lt;lb/&gt; Southend, Victoria House&lt;lb/&gt; Stevenage, Brickdale&lt;lb/&gt; House SSO&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;East Midlands&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Chesterfield Jobcentre&lt;lb/&gt; Derby, Becket Street&lt;lb/&gt; Leicester, Wellington Street&lt;lb/&gt; Lincoln, Orchard House SSO&lt;lb/&gt; Mansfield SSO&lt;lb/&gt; Nottingham Pension Centre&lt;lb/&gt; Wellingborough SSO&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Worksop, Crown House&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;North East&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Newcastle, Cobalt House&lt;lb/&gt; Stockton Pension Centre&lt;lb/&gt; Sunderland, Wearview House&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Bishop Auckland SSO&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;North West&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Liverpool, Belle Vale&lt;lb/&gt; Birkenhead, Horden House&lt;lb/&gt; Blackpool, Marton Mere&lt;lb/&gt; Bolton, Elizabeth House&lt;lb/&gt; Burnley, Brun House&lt;lb/&gt; Carlisle, Rufus House&lt;lb/&gt; Chester, Chantry Chorlton&lt;lb/&gt; Huyton, Edendale House&lt;lb/&gt; Hyde, Beech House&lt;lb/&gt; Oldham, Phoenix House&lt;lb/&gt; Preston, Barry House&lt;lb/&gt; St. Helens, Gregson House&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Bury, Humphrey House&lt;lb/&gt; SSO&lt;lb/&gt; Kirkby, Webster House&lt;lb/&gt; SSO&lt;lb/&gt; Rochdale, Newgate&lt;lb/&gt; House&lt;lb/&gt; Salford, Aldine House&lt;lb/&gt; SSO&lt;lb/&gt; Salfrod, Baskerville&lt;lb/&gt; House SSO&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Scotland&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Bathgate SSO&lt;lb/&gt; Clydebank SSO&lt;lb/&gt; Coatbridge SSO&lt;lb/&gt; Glasgow (site tbc)&lt;lb/&gt; Greenock Jobcentre Plus&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Coatbridge Jobcentre&lt;lb/&gt; Hamilton SSO&lt;lb/&gt; Kircaldy SSO&lt;lb/&gt; Perth SSO&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;180WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Inverness SSO&lt;lb/&gt; Kilmarnock SSO&lt;lb/&gt; Springburn SSO&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;South East&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Broadstairs&lt;lb/&gt; Canterbury&lt;lb/&gt; Cosham&lt;lb/&gt; Dover&lt;lb/&gt; Hastings Child Support&lt;lb/&gt; Agency Centre&lt;lb/&gt; Milton Keynes&lt;lb/&gt; Newport (IoW)&lt;lb/&gt; Ramsgate Totton SSO&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Ashford, Kent House&lt;lb/&gt; Jobcentre&lt;lb/&gt; Chatham, Brook House&lt;lb/&gt; Jobcentre&lt;lb/&gt; Sittingbourne Jobcentre&lt;lb/&gt; Tunbridge Wells SSO&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;South West&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Bournemouth, Cotlands Road&lt;lb/&gt; Bristol East, Lodge House&lt;lb/&gt; Chippenham, St. Pauls&lt;lb/&gt; Gloucester, Cedar House&lt;lb/&gt; Plymouth&lt;lb/&gt; St. Austell, Carlyon House&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Bath, somerset Hall&lt;lb/&gt; Jobcentre&lt;lb/&gt; Bristol, St. Catherine&apos;s&lt;lb/&gt; House SSO&lt;lb/&gt; Cheltenham SSO&lt;lb/&gt; Trowbridge SSO&lt;lb/&gt; Weston Super Mare,&lt;lb/&gt; Carlton House&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Wales&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Caerphilly, Crown Buildings&lt;lb/&gt; Llanellie, Crown Buildings&lt;lb/&gt; Myrthyr Tydfil.

      <outline id='3578235' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Mr. Chris Pond)&lt;p&gt;Improving member protection is a Government priority. The Pension Protection Fund and the Pensions Regulator form the basis of providing such protection and successful introduction of both organisations is a priority of this Government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Pensions Bill is continuing its passage through the House there has been cross-party support for the principles behind both the Pension Protection Fund and the Pensions Regulator and the desire to provide protection for individuals as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intention, subject to parliamentary approval, is to achieve successful introduction of both organisations by April 2005. This timetable is very challenging and in&#x000A;&lt;image src="S6CV0424P2I0098"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;181WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;order to make this date a reality it is necessary for the Department for Work and Pensions to carry out essential activities in advance of the legislation receiving Royal Assent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Parliamentary approval for additional resources of &amp;#x00A3;477,000 for these new services will be sought in a supplementary estimate for the Department for Work and Pensions as soon as legislation is passed. Pending that approval, this urgent expenditure will be met by repayable cash advances from the contingency fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, although no cash advance is required, the Department for Work and Pensions will be agreeing to contractual and lease arrangements in respect of accommodation in Croydon, where the staff of the Pension Protection Fund will be located. These negotiations are ongoing, however the Department will endeavour to keep resource consequences to a minimum. When these costs are known the Department will inform the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Croydon was chosen as it met the three key criteria, essential to ensure that the Pension Protection Fund can operate with optimum effectiveness and efficiency, within the required deadline. These key criteria are: achieving successful implementation&amp;#x2014;which includes direct links and proximity to both the Pension Regulator in Brighton and key stakeholders in London: ability to recruit the right staff and value for money.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Pension Protection Fund/Pension Regulator' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/pension-protection-fundpension-regulator'></outline>

Some strategic management policies were lacking and this meant that managers and staff did not have a clear understanding of what was essential to deliver a high quality service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below this, a lack of procedural guidance hindered benefits administration and counter-fraud work. Processes were based on custom and practice, which meant that staff had no reference materials and there was no assurance safeguards for new staff. Despite the lack of documented policies and procedures, the standard of work in many areas was generally good and the report notes the improvement in claims processing times which were just outside the upper quartile performance for all local authorities in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particular weaknesses were found, however, in customer services. A best value benefits satisfaction survey that was due in 2003 had not been undertaken. There had been no measurement of customer waiting times or assessment of the telephone service provided.&#x000A;&lt;image src="S6CV0424P2I0099"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;183WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;No formal take-up strategy was in place and BFI concluded that the council was not providing adequate information to current or potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report found that informal working relationships between departments in the council had resulted in poor communications that were detrimental to benefits service customers. The housing unit had sent repossession notices to council tenants with rent arrears even when the arrears were due to benefit claims not having been processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report raises concern that there had been little work undertaken to recover overpayments. This had resulted in an accruing debt and consequential loss of available funds to the council. Although it was still to achieve its first successful prosecution, the application of other sanctions was an encouraging sign that the council was establishing an effective counter-fraud operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to further improve the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit, as well as counter-fraud activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My right hon.

      <outline id='3578249' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr. Bill Rammell)&lt;p&gt;I visited the Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea (DPRK or north Korea) from 11 to 14 September. It was the first ever visit by a British Minister. I undertook the trip because the north Koreans had agreed, for the first time, to substantive discussions on the nuclear issue and human rights. I met Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun, Chairman of the Supreme People&apos;s Assembly Chae Thae Bok, Human Rights Minister Choe Su Hon and Kim Gye Gwan, head of the DPRK&apos;s delegation to the six-party talks on dismantling north Korea&apos;s nuclear programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stressed to Foreign Minister Paek and Chief Negotiator Kim Gye Gwan the importance which the UK and the international community attach to the continuation of the Six Party Talks. For some time, it has been clear that the north Koreans might not proceed with the scheduled fourth round of talks by the end of September. The Foreign Minister restated the DPRK&apos;s commitment to the talks process, but admitted the DPRK&apos;s reluctance to meet again in September. I also impressed the need for the DPRK to admit its Uranium Enrichment Programme, and encouraged the regime to look to the example of Libya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before my visit the FCO delegation consulted on the human rights situation with three leading NGOs&amp;#x2014;Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Christian Solidarity World-wide. Armed with detailed information on individual cases, I was able to hand to Human Rights Minister Choe Su Hon a list of 18 named individuals, and asked for a full written response. In particular, I raised the cases of two south Korean pastors reportedly abducted to the DPRK from China whose details we learned about from Christian Solidarity World-wide. I handed over satellite photographs of what appear to be a number of large prison camps in the DPRK and asked for both an explanation and for access to them by diplomats resident in Pyongyang. I also pressed for the north Koreans to allow visits, so far barred, by the recently appointed UN Special Rapporteur for human rights in&#x000A;&lt;image src="S6CV0424P2I0101"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;187WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;the DPRK and by other thematic UN human rights Special Rapporteurs; and further visits by Foreign Office Human Rights experts. I hope to hear more about this at the UN General Assembly next week when I will meet Choe Su Hon again to continue our discussions. I repeatedly made the points that blanket denials by the north Koreans of alleged human rights violations were simply not credible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My visit coincided with reports of a large explosion in the north of the country. Having asked for an explanation, Foreign Minister Peak said it was a planned explosion of a mountain for the construction of a hydro-electric power plant. He agreed to my request that diplomats might visit to see for themselves. The&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;188WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;arrangements are now in hand. The British Ambassador visited the blast site today; I have asked for an urgent report on the visit.&lt;/p&gt;' title='North Korea' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/north-korea'></outline>

      <outline id='2551547' text='Baroness Amos&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11225"&gt;My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Mr Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11226"&gt;On 14 September 2004 I provided the House with an oral Statement on the impact that Hurricane Ivan was having on a number of islands in the Caribbean. I would like to update the House today, in advance of the recess, on the latest situation and the international relief effort being undertaken. I will provide a further Written Statement following the return of the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11227"&gt;Hurricane Ivan has now passed through the Caribbean and is in the Gulf of Mexico. It was downgraded to a category 4 hurricane and made landfall along the United States coast on 15 September. It took one week, from 7 to 14 September, for the hurricane to travel from Grenada, to Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and finally western Cuba, causing over 60 deaths and severe damage along its way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11228"&gt;The situation in Grenada continues to be serious. The latest reports from the island indicate that 37 people died and over 300 were injured as a result of the hurricane. Two-thirds of the population (60,000 people) are reportedly affected and it is estimated that between 4,000 and 5,000 people are living in shelters. The range of figures reflects that many of these shelters are private houses of which there are up to 200. Electricity supply continues to be a problem and piped water is available to only about a third of households across the island. In the mean time water tankers are operating, but fuel is in short supply. This is hampering both transport and emergency electricity generation. The main hospital is working and sustained only minor damage. Drugs are in short&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 122&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;supply as the main stock was destroyed. Other hospitals on the island suffered more extensive damage. There is a dawn to dusk curfew following the looting that occurred immediately after the hurricane had hit the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11229"&gt;The relief operation is scaling up quickly but continues to face problems with co-ordination and communications. The emergency operation centre building was destroyed in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane but was brought back into operation by the efforts of HMS "Richmond". It is now fully operational with assistance from the regional Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency and a recently arrived United Nations disaster assessment and co-ordination team. Roads and airports are now open. Distribution of food and other relief items is proceeding slowly, in part due to fuel shortage and in part due to the scale of properly assessing where need is greatest. The United Nations team will help in prioritising the delivery of supplies. Communicating with the population is also a constraint. There are only FM broadcasts operational, and these do not reach the whole island. The two dependencies of Carriacou and Petit Martinique have yet to be assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11230"&gt;As I reported to the House on 14 September, the Department for International Development delivered plastic sheeting for 1,400 families and water containers for 11,000 people on 11 September and made an immediate contribution of some &amp;#x00A3;83,000 to the Pan American Health Organisation. We have since made a contribution of &amp;#x00A3;132,000 to the preliminary appeal for Grenada of the International Federation of the Red Cross. The Pan American Health Organisation and the International Federation of the Red Cross are both active in Grenada. The Pan American Health Organisation has deployed medical personnel and vaccines. The International Federation of the Red Cross has sent a number of relief flights with basic relief items, including shelter materials. The Department for International Development is continuing to monitor the situation closely, in particular the level of medical supplies on the island, and will consider providing further relief assistance as needs become clearer. We are in daily contact with the Pan American Health Organisation concerning health needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11231"&gt;The United States Agency for International Development has provided plastic sheeting for 25,000 people and other relief items in Grenada. The Canadian International Development Agency has approved support of &amp;#x00A3;211,100 and the European Community&apos;s Humanitarian Office has approved an allocation of &amp;#x00A3;1.03 million for Grenada. The bulk of this allocation will go towards the Red Cross operation and Oxfam who are assisting with emergency water and sanitation work. The United Kingdom&apos;s share of this European Community support is about &amp;#x00A3;200,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11232"&gt;The two-person humanitarian assessment team sent to the region by the Department for International Development arrived in Kingston, Jamaica on 13 September. On 14 September, they met with representatives from the Government of Jamaica, national and international organizations, and other donors. They report good co-ordination between the&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0664P0I1067"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 123&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;Government&apos;s Office for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, the Jamaican Red Cross, the Salvation Army and the United Nations disaster assistance and co-ordination team. Joint rapid assessments are under way with several areas of the island already identified as the most severely affected. These areas include Westmoreland, Claredon, Morant Bay, May Penn and the north-east Blue Mountains. It is not thought that there is widespread devastation but there are a number of pockets of devastation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11233"&gt;Until the assessments are completed, exact figures are difficult to come by but there are reported to be 200 to 245 shelters open, serving between 4,000 to 13,000 residents across the island. Water is the key issue in many of the hardest hit communities. Food stocks in the Blue Mountain region were reported as running low. Heavy flooding in the surrounding area is delaying assessments. As an interim measure, the Government of Jamaica through their defence forces have airlifted an initial stock of food to the region. The Red Cross has also delivered relief supplies. Although most of the hospitals are operational, they report a lack of power and water supplies with much of the ground water contaminated. The Pan American Health Organisation is working with the Ministry of Health to identify specific needs in the health sector and resolve these problems. A number of non-governmental organisations have undertaken preliminary assessments to address short-term relief needs. The Department for International Development has received requests for funding support from Save the Children, Oxfam and ADRA. These proposals are being urgently considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11234"&gt;The Department for International Development assessment team arrived on the Cayman Islands, from Jamaica, on 15 September. They are assisting the Government in undertaking urgent humanitarian needs assessments, which will determine what further urgent supplies are required. Initial estimates indicate 15&amp;#x2013;20 per cent of residential houses completely destroyed and 20 per cent with major damage. The Department for International Development had already responded to an earlier request for assistance by procuring 3 million water purification tablets, 50 chainsaws, 500 camp cots for children and 5,000 pieces of plastic sheeting. These supplies are on their way to the island, with our first relief flight arriving today. The International Federation of the Red Cross is also planning a relief flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11235"&gt;The Governor is concerned about maintaining security on the islands and is looking to obtain additional security support. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is considering the request. The Governor is not aware of medical supply problems but the assessment being undertaken will confirm these and other needs. The main concern appears to be water supply and the need to deliver water purification tablets, which the Department for International Development is supplying. A water trucking system is being set up. HMS "Richmond" sent a 17-person party on shore on 14 September. They have repaired generators, attended to damaged buildings and have been providing food distributions. Of a population of 42,000, approximately 3,000 people remain in shelters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 124&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11236"&gt;Food supplies are being delivered to all shelters. The airport on the island is now fully operational and busy with both passenger and cargo aircraft. This has enabled 30 dialysis patients needing emergency dialysis and ongoing care to be airlifted to the United States by Cayman Airways. Shops have reopened. The Caribbean Utilities Company will support restoration of power supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11237"&gt;Ivan swung past the western edge of Cuba late on 13 September as a category 5 hurricane. One and a half million people had been evacuated from the area by the Cuban authorities, with 300,000 people placed in shelters. The western area of Cuba is sparsely populated and there have been no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or serious damage to buildings. It is mainly a tobacco-growing area but planting does not begin till next month so limited damage is expected on tobacco crops. Its impact on agricultural installations and housing in coastal areas is to be reported. Airports have reopened and children are expected to return to school this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11238"&gt;The Ministry of Foreign Investment and Economic Co-operation is forming an assessment team to inform the Government of needs. Cuba prepared itself well ahead of the hurricane and fortunately appears to have been spared the full force of the hurricane, and national emergency services have mobilised rapidly to distribute food and non-food items to displaced people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11239"&gt;While Hurricane Ivan has passed out of the Caribbean, hurricane warnings remain in place for the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Residents and tourists have been evacuated from areas likely to be affected by strong winds and waves. No reports are yet available on the impact on the Yucatan Peninsula but damage is likely to be contained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11240"&gt;Further information on the continuing relief effort to affected islands will be made available via the Department for International Development website &lt;u&gt;www.dfid.gov.uk.&lt;/u&gt; This will include details of how concerned members of the public could help via relief agencies.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Hurricane Ivan' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/hurricane-ivan'></outline>

I met Prime Minister Allawi, development Ministers, representatives from the United Nations, civil society and the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq, and representatives from local government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11243"&gt;The interim Iraqi Government are now clearly in charge, although recent events in Najaf have dominated their first months in power. The difficult security situation has inevitably slowed down the reconstruction effort of not just the UK, but also other donors and the multilateral agencies. However, it was&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0664P0I1068"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 125&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;clear that progress is still being made. 45 kilometres of water pipes have been laid in Basra since my last visit in February and electricity distribution is now more equitable across the national grid. Partially due to these efforts, the riots that happened in Basra last summer because of the lack of basic services have not reoccurred this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11244"&gt;While in Iraq I announced a number of new UK bilateral projects, focusing on building the capacity of the Iraqi administration, and promoting employment creation, in southern Iraq. These projects mark an important step forward in our reconstruction efforts in southern Iraq as we move from meeting short-term humanitarian and immediate infrastructure rehabilitation needs towards addressing longer-term development challenges. Southern Iraq should receive massive reconstruction funds over next two to three years from a range of sources, including the USA, Japan and the World Bank and UN trust funds. One of DFID&apos;s aims is to help the Iraqi administration to ensure that this money is spent quickly and well, and that the benefits of reconstruction are widely shared across the population. We are investing &amp;#x00A3;20.5 million in strengthening local management, planning and financial capacity in the four southern governorates of Basra, Muthanna, Dhi Qar and Maysan, including &amp;#x00A3;15 million for projects developed by the governorates. We have also started a new &amp;#x00A3;16.5 million programme to finance employment programmes and further emergency infrastructure repairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11245"&gt;DfID has committed &amp;#x00A3;331 million to humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in Iraq since March 2003. Of this total &amp;#x00A3;78 million has been allocated to bilateral reconstruction projects in southern Iraq; &amp;#x00A3;19 million to support for the new interim Iraqi Government, the justice sector, independent media, civil society and political participation; and &amp;#x00A3;28 million for consultants and secondments to the Coalition Provisional Authority while it was in office up to 28 June. &amp;#x00A3;70 million has been paid into the trust funds managed by the United Nations and the World Bank, to be spent primarily on health, education, water and sanitation projects, assistance for refugees and strengthening governance; and nearly &amp;#x00A3;12 million has been committed to IMF and International Finance Corporation programmes for economic governance support and small business development. Updates on DfID&apos;s programmes can be found on the Internet at &lt;u&gt;www.dfid.gov.uk,&lt;/u&gt; as well as in the House Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11246"&gt;As on my previous two visits to Iraq, I was impressed by the extraordinary courage and commitment of all the people, both international and Iraqi, who are working to help the new Iraqi Government and the people of Iraq to build the better future that they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Iraq: Reconstruction' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/iraq-reconstruction'></outline>

In recent years, the United Kingdom, with the international community, has been increasingly involved in helping countries to stabilise after conflict. We need to deal better with conflict and instability, learn lessons and improve our capability to respond. Within this broader context, there is particular scope to improve the way in which we deal with immediate post-conflict situations, especially those which include military and civilian components. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Ministry of Defence and Department for International Development are working closely to develop the capabilities that are needed. The Foreign Secretary will chair a new Cabinet Sub-Committee on Post-Conflict Reconstruction. My right honourable friends and I expect to be in a position formally to establish an inter-departmental Post-Conflict Reconstruction Unit later this year to lead this work. It will have a policy and operational role. In spring 2005 we anticipate being able to inform Parliament about its initial capabilities.

In the case of Pakistan, the loan concerned was to the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11252"&gt;The only other inter-governmental debt between the UK and Pakistan relates to export credit guarantees. Following the Paris Club agreement, this debt was rescheduled and is now valued at only &amp;#x00A3;9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11253"&gt;In 2001 DfID agreed to cancel the ex-CDC debt, subject to Pakistan completing the second review of the poverty reduction growth facility (PRGF) with the International Monetary Fund. In the interim, the debt was suspended with no interest payments required from Pakistan to DfID. On 23 June 2004 the IMF executive board successfully completed the second annual review of Pakistan&apos;s PRGF, implying the ex-CDC debt can now be cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11254"&gt;The Pakistan programme continues to be a high priority for DfID.

Over the next two years (2004&amp;#x2013;05 and 2005&amp;#x2013;06), DfID&apos;s assistance to Pakistan will be &amp;#x00A3;70 million and &amp;#x00A3;74 million respectively. This will support the Government of Pakistan in achieving the millennium development goals through the implementation of their poverty reduction strategy (published in December 2003).

      <outline id='2551569' text='The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean)&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11279"&gt;My honourable friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr Bill Rammell) visited the Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) from 11 to 14 September. It was the first ever visit by a British Minister. He undertook the trip because the North Koreans had agreed, for the first time, to substantive discussions on the nuclear issue and human rights. He met Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun, Chairman of the Supreme People&apos;s Assembly Chae Thae Bok, Human Rights Minister Choe Su Hon and Kim Gye Gwan, head of the DPRK&apos;s delegation to the six-party talks on dismantling North Korea&apos;s nuclear programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11280"&gt;Mr Rammell stressed to Foreign Minister Paek and chief negotiator Kim Gye Gwan the importance which&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0664P0I1070"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 129&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;the UK and the international community attach to the continuation of the six-party talks. For some time, it has been clear that the North Koreans might not proceed with the scheduled fourth round of talks by the end of September. The Foreign Minister restated the DPRK&apos;s commitment to the talks process, but admitted the DPRK&apos;s reluctance to meet again in September. Mr Rammell also impressed the need for the DPRK to admit its uranium enrichment programme, and encouraged the regime to look to the example of Libya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11281"&gt;Before the visit, the FCO delegation consulted on the human rights situation with three leading NGOs&amp;#x2014;Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Christian Solidarity World-wide. Armed with detailed information on individual cases, Mr Rammell was able to hand to Human Rights Minister Choe Su Hon a list of 18 named individuals, and asked for a full written response. In particular, he raised the cases of two South Korean pastors reportedly abducted to the DPRK from China whose details we learnt about from Christian Solidarity World-wide. He handed over satellite photographs of what appear to be a number of large prison camps in the DPRK and asked for both an explanation and access to them by diplomats resident in Pyongyang. He also pressed for the North Koreans to allow visits, so far barred, by the recently appointed UN special rapporteur for human rights in the DPRK and by other thematic UN human rights special rapporteurs; and further visits by Foreign Office human rights experts. Mr Rammell hopes to hear more about this at the UN General Assembly next week when he will meet Choe Su Hon again to continue discussions. He repeatedly made the points that blanket denials by the North Koreans of alleged human rights violations were simply not credible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11282"&gt;Mr Rammell&apos;s visit coincided with reports of a large explosion in the north of the country. Having asked for an explanation, Foreign Minister Peak said it was a planned explosion of a mountain for the construction of a hydro-electric power plant. He agreed to the request that diplomats might visit to see for themselves. The arrangements are now in hand. The British Ambassador visited the blast site today, we have asked for an urgent report on the visit.&lt;/p&gt;' title='North Korea' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/north-korea'></outline>

      <outline id='2551571' text='The Minister of State, Home Office (Baroness Scotland of Asthal)&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11283"&gt;A key element in the Government&apos;s strategy to speed up the processing of asylum claims has been the introduction of the fast-track asylum processes operated initially at the Oakington Reception Centre and now also at Harmondsworth Removal Centre and other locations. The use of detention to fast-track suitable claims under these processes is necessary to achieve the objective of delivering decisions quickly. This ensures, among other things, that those whose claims can be quickly decided can be removed as quickly as possible in the event that the claim is unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11284"&gt;The lawfulness of detaining asylum claimants for the sole purpose of deciding their claims quickly was&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 130&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;upheld by the Court of Appeal and by the House of Lords in the case of Saadi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11285"&gt;When we began the fast-track process we said that it was our intention to detain asylum claimants suitable for a quick decision for a period of about seven to 10 days. If we could not decide the claim within that timescale, the claimant would be released or moved to another place of detention with the facilities to support people detained for longer periods. In the vast majority of cases, we have been able to do exactly that. However, the need to ensure a really sharp focus on quality decision making, including for example in non-suspensive appeal (NSA) cases the need for a second pair of eyes, means we cannot always make decisions and serve them on claimants within the original seven to 10 day target timescale. While we are able to do this in over 95 per cent of non-NSA Oakington claims, our experience has shown us that NSA claims take slightly longer, with the majority of decisions being made and served within 14 days. The purpose of this announcement is to set out our revised fast-track process detention policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11286"&gt;The fast-track process has scheduled days set aside for specific activities (interviewing, serving the decision etc) but we intend this to be a guide to how the process will generally operate. There will always be occasions when for operational or other reasons it is not possible to undertake certain activities. This may be because the claimant is temporarily unwell, there is an interpreter problem, the claimant requires longer to obtain further evidence or wishes to submit late representations for example. The process must be flexible enough to accommodate such circumstances. We would not necessarily release people from detention or from the process or move them to another place of detention simply because the timetable cannot he adhered to, if the indications are that we can make and serve a decision within a reasonable timescale. However, the period of detention for making a quick decision will not be allowed to continue for longer than is reasonable in all the circumstances. We will aim to make decisions within 10 to 14 days, but there will be occasions where it is quicker, for example at Harmondsworth or a non-NSA decision at Oakington. However, we will continue to detain for the purpose of deciding the claim quickly, even beyond the 10 to 14-day timescale, unless the length of time before a decision can be made looks as if it will be longer than is reasonable in all the circumstances. Continued detention may also be merited in some cases irrespective of decision timescale, where our general detention criteria apply. We may also detain claimants after we have made and served a decision in accordance with our general detention criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11287"&gt;Applicants with dependants may be detained for the purposes of making a quick decision on their claim, but there may be operational constraints on who can be detained from time to time. For example, the acceptance of families or pregnant females into Oakington may be halted temporarily if there is an illness circulating which might be harmful to them&amp;#x2014;chicken pox for example. The criteria for acceptance are applied equally to those entering the Oakington&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0664P0I1071"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 131&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;and Harmondsworth processes. The principal difference is that at Oakington, individuals with dependants on their asylum claims can be detained at the centre and at Harmondsworth they cannot. Separating dependants on a claim from the claimant can present operational difficulties and for that reason and the fact that it has no female or family accommodation, Harmondsworth will, in general, only accept male claimants who have no dependants on their claims. That is not to say that, at Oakington or Harmondsworth or any other location where fast-tracking is carried out, we will never detain a claimant who has dependants on their claim, even where it is not possible to detain the dependants with the claimant. There may be occasions when we believe it is necessary and right so to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11288"&gt;When deciding who to accept into fast-track processes, account is taken of any particular individual circumstances known to us which might make the claim particularly complex or unlikely to be resolved in the timescales, however flexibly applied. The existence of UK-based family ties (such as a spouse, partner or child) would not automatically exclude a claimant from the process as some issues, such as Article 8 family life ones, can be relatively easy to decide quickly given the case law and the individual&apos;s actual circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11289"&gt;We will continually review how our fast-track processes are operating, the criteria for acceptance into them and the indicative process timescales we aim for. This will apply equally to those we are presently operating and to any we may seek to introduce as part of our overall strategy of speeding up the asylum process and making it more effective.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Asylum Claimants and Detention Policy' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/asylum-claimants-and-detention-policy'></outline>

The Royal Navy is now assessing applications as they are received (5 February 2004 as at 19 July 2004), the Royal Air Force is assessing applications received on 30 December 2003 (26 November as at 19 July), and although the Army Medal Office is still assessing applications from 31 October 2003, this is due to some 4,300 applications being received during that week. This peak in applications, which occurred following my Statement to the House on 23 October, is nearly cleared and the assessment of applications received during November will begin very shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 132&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11293"&gt;While this significant Army backlog remains, a number of measures implemented by the joint personnel administration team responsible for setting up the MoD Medal Office at RAF Innsworth are already bringing tangible benefits. A new medal laser engraving facility has recently been installed at Innsworth. This is currently being used solely to engrave Iraq medals and over 6,000 have been produced during its first four weeks of operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11294"&gt;This has allowed the engraving facility at the Army Medal Office to concentrate its efforts on the Suez Canal Zone Medal and as a result, the engraving backlog of some 1,800 medals has been cleared during the last month. Improvements to the information systems used by the Army Medal Office, the facility to work overtime and the diversion of staff to Suez Canal Zone Medal processing are helping to improve matters further. These measures, coupled with the concerted efforts of Army Medal Office staff have brought about an increase of approximately 30 per cent in the Army assessment rate during recent weeks. This increase in output has resulted in an average of some 120 more applications per week being assessed since July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11295"&gt;I can also announce that with effect from 1 October 2004 the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency will assume full responsibility for the management of medal output, target setting and performance monitoring. This will allow many of the benefits of a single MoD Medal Office, such as common procedures based on single service best practice, to be introduced prior to its actual formation date next spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11296"&gt;Following these initial changes, I now anticipate that the backlog should be cleared by January 2006 and I hope this can continue to be improved upon. I should like to pay tribute to the staff of the single Service medal offices for their part in bringing about this improvement.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Suez Canal Zone Medal' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/suez-canal-zone-medal'></outline>

      <outline id='2551579' text='Lord Sainsbury of Turville&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11307"&gt;My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Hewitt) has made the following Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11308"&gt;The Performance and Innovation Unit report on modernising the post office network, published in June 2000, recommended that the Government should support the rural network in the first instance to 2006. It also recommended that the Postal Services Commission, Postcomm, should advise the Government on options for the rural network after 2006. I have received that advice and have considered it very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11309"&gt;The Government are fully committed to supporting the Post Office&apos;s strategy for creating a viable and vibrant post office network that meets changing customer needs, providing reasonable access to services in rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11310"&gt;My honourable friend the then Minister of State for Energy, E-Commerce and Postal Services announced in the House on 2 December 2002 the Government&apos;s decision to make &amp;#x00A3;450 million available to support the rural post office network through from 2003 to 2006. That three-year package was intended as a transitional measure, designed to help rural post offices through the changes in the network&apos;s business between 2003 and 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11311"&gt;At this point in the transition rural post offices continue to face real challenges and a large part of the rural network continues to be unsustainable commercially. For many post offices the number of customers they serve is simply too small to make the business attractive or sustainable. With the prospect of customer numbers continuing to fall as people access services in different ways it is clear that there are challenges ahead and that new ways to deliver services more efficiently and effectively are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11312"&gt;How and where people access services is changing. It is not clear that the present network best meets those changing needs, or whether because of that the current shape and scale of the rural network is a viable long-term prospect. A solution for the longer-term will need to take these changes fully into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11313"&gt;Against this background Postcomm has advised the Government to review the reasons for and nature of our support of the rural network in the longer term. They advise that the nature of that support may need to change substantially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11314"&gt;Postcomm&apos;s advice recognises that such changes must be well informed and that further work will be necessary. Pilot activity by the Post Office, funded by the Government, to test new ways of ensuring access to post office services in rural areas is under way. The lessons that will emerge from these trials over the next 12 to 18 months will be crucial in informing longer-term decisions about the future shape of the rural post office network. At this stage it is simply too early to draw conclusions. The Government have therefore concluded that now is not the right time to take decisions about the long-term future of the rural network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 136&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11315"&gt;It is, however, vital that we continue to support the network through this continuing difficult period. The Government are committed to ensuring reasonable access for rural communities to postal and other services. It is also clear from Postcomm&apos;s advice to us that without government funding much of the current rural network would face closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11316"&gt;I am therefore pleased to announce that the Government have decided, subject to securing any further necessary state aid clearance from the European Commission, to extend the transitional financial facility for rural post offices for two further years from 2006 until 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11317"&gt;The Government will make available up to a maximum of &amp;#x00A3;150 million a year until 2008 to enable Post Office Ltd to continue to meet the cost of maintaining the non-commercial part of the rural post office network and to pilot new ways of delivering services. Pilot activity is a key element of the current funding package&amp;#x2014;we have already allocated &amp;#x00A3;25 million to fund pilots. Our intention is that this will continue to be a key element of the package going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11318"&gt;The funding will ensure that Post Office Ltd will have money to test new ways of delivering services and will not be forced to close unprofitable rural post offices because of a lack of funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11319"&gt;Current funding is from the gilts (government money previously received as "dividends" from the company and made available back to the company for certain specific uses) and it is our intention that the further funding to April 2008 will also come from these gilts. The detailed mechanism, sums of money and timing of payments will be subject to further detailed discussion with the company, as well as being subject to state aid clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11320"&gt;The PIU report recommended that the Post Office should be required to prevent avoidable closures of rural post offices, in the first instance to 2006. Postcomm has advised us that it is concerned that this policy can lead to post offices being saved or reopened where it is clear that customer numbers have dwindled to levels far below what is sustainable. Furthermore it has recommended that this policy should not be extended beyond April 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11321"&gt;The Government&apos;s direction to Post Office Limited to maintain the network and do all it can to prevent avoidable closures remains in place. There is no question of it being able to initiate the closure of offices. However, in response to Postcomm&apos;s immediate concern I propose to amend the definition of what is unavoidable so that when Post Office Ltd is responding to a closure (for example when a sub-postmaster decides to retire) it takes into account circumstances where there is no prospect of a viable future for a post office because of a collapse in demand for services in a particular location. The intention will be to ensure that Post Office Ltd is focused on maintaining access to services in rural areas fully taking into account local circumstances. These changes, yet to be worked up in detail, will be published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11322"&gt;I believe that we will be better placed to take a decision on the longer-term future of the rural network, including whether the current policy on avoidable closures should&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0664P0I1074"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 137&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;continue beyond April 2006, when we have feedback from the pilot activity now being undertaken by the Post Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11323"&gt;I propose therefore to ask Post Office Ltd for a full report on pilot activity and its implications for future access to post office services by the end of 2005. I will then review the policy on avoidable closures beyond April 2006 at that point.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Rural Post Offices' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/rural-post-offices'></outline>

The Government will announce a 10-year childcare strategy in the Pre-Budget Report when more detailed plans will be published. The broad areas to be covered will include:&#x000A;&lt;ul&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;By 2008, there will be up to 2,500 children&apos;s centres;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Bringing education and childcare together into a single integrated offer for pre-school children; and&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Developing a year round, 8am-6pm, childcare offer in many primary schools; with secondary schools offering a range of "things for young people to do".&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11330"&gt;Investment in children&apos;s services will increase by almost &amp;#x00A3;1 billion by 2007&amp;#x2013;08 compared with 2004&amp;#x2013;05. We will use this investment to start taking forward key areas of reforms set out in &lt;i&gt;Every Child Matters&lt;/i&gt; to achieve better opportunities and outcomes for children, young people and their families. We will provide support in the following areas:&#x000A;&lt;ul&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Increase the information available to parents and carers.&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the professionals working with children have the skills and competencies to&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 138&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;support children and their families more effectively.&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Improve support to looked-after children by enhancing the provision of mentoring to this group and improve support to foster carers in order to increase recruitment and retention.&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Improve early identification and protection of vulnerable children by supporting a common assessment framework and developing arrangements for sharing information between agencies to prevent any child slipping through the net.&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11331"&gt;We are committed to rationalising funding streams to local authorities and the voluntary sector and reducing the number of processes. We will discuss with partners how resources can be delivered to ensure funding can be flexibly deployed at the front-line where delivery of services impact most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11332"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Schools&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11333"&gt;We will increase revenue funding for schools by some &amp;#x00A3;3.5 billion overall between 2005&amp;#x2013;06 and 2007&amp;#x2013;08. That means that we will have increased revenue funding for schools by about &amp;#x00A3;1,300 per pupil or 45 per cent in real terms in the years since we took office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11334"&gt;Our twin aims are to make the quality of teaching even better than it is now with schools driving their own and others&apos; improvement and to widen opportunities for pupils and teachers through enriching the curriculum. Specific examples of additional investment include:&#x000A;&lt;ul&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;The budget for specialist schools will increase by over &amp;#x00A3;100 million by 2008 to help all schools who meet the standard to become specialist;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;There will be an extra &amp;#x00A3;30 million by 2008 for our leading schools which will be expected to work together with other schools to raise standards everywhere;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;There will be an extra &amp;#x00A3;65 million a year for our primary and secondary strategies which have helped to increase pupil attainment since 1997, with resources targeted on those schools which need the greatest support;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;There will be continuing support for schools in areas served by the Excellence in Cities programme which has helped to improve exam results at a faster rate than the national average;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;We will be making additional resources to the Teacher Training Agency to improve the supply of high quality maths and science teachers and support the professional development of teachers; and&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;To help schools to enrich the curriculum, the budget for sport will increase by over &amp;#x00A3;30 million by 2007&amp;#x2013;08 and there will also be more resources for music, modern foreign languages and partnerships between schools and the arts.&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11335"&gt;We look forward in the months ahead to discussions with schools and local education authorities on the best way to deliver all the resources which support&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0664P0I1075"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 139&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;schools. We will have a new ring-fenced budget for schools from 2006&amp;#x2013;07 and are committed both to delivering three-year budgets for schools and to rationalising the existing funding streams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11336"&gt;Capital investment in schools will increase by &amp;#x00A3;750 million to &amp;#x00A3;6.3 billion by 2007&amp;#x2013;08 including ICT and PFI credits to support further improvements to all schools and allowing every secondary school to be refurbished or rebuilt to a modern standard over the next 10 to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11337"&gt;&lt;i&gt;14&amp;#x2013;19, Further Education (FE) and Skills&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11338"&gt;Total funding for FE, skills and to develop the 14&amp;#x2013;19 phase will rise by &amp;#x00A3;1.5 billion by 2007&amp;#x2013;08 compared to 2004&amp;#x2013;05, taking the Government&apos;s total expenditure on post-16 (excluding higher education (HE)) to &amp;#x00A3;11 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11339"&gt;This is a substantial overall investment, building on the increases in funding in the three years up to 2005&amp;#x2013;06, which will allow the sector to meet growth in 16&amp;#x2013;19 participation and enable progress to be sustained on two key agendas: delivering success for all to continue to drive up quality, and reshaping the sector to become more demand-led as set out in the skills strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11340"&gt;We will provide greater freedom for colleges and training providers through a new delivery structure. This will be based on autonomy and independence for good colleges and providers, backed up by a risk-based approach to lighter touch inspection but tougher sanctions on poor quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11341"&gt;This will enable colleges to engage more effectively with employers by offering the training that they need, and to increase employer and individual co-financing of training in line with the benefits they receive. This is important for the sustainability of the sector and future expansion. We want all colleges to be put on a secure financial footing to deliver the important challenges that we have set out in our five-year strategy. Under the new delivery arrangements, successful colleges will be able to grow and prosper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11342"&gt;The settlement includes funding to continue the development of a transformed 14&amp;#x2013;19 phase of education, in the light of the commitments made in the department&apos;s five-year strategy. The working group on 14&amp;#x2013;19 reform, chaired by Mike Tomlinson, will issue its final report this autumn making proposals for a radical reshaping of the 14&amp;#x2013;19 phase. The Government have set out the five tests which will shape their response to the proposals, but whatever the response, the direction of travel is clear. We are therefore allocating funds to build on the work over the past few years to improve this phase of education, including workforce training and spreading good practice from the 14&amp;#x2013;19 pathfinders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11343"&gt;We must support colleges in making the transition to a more demand-led approach in which greater funding comes from employers and individuals, because the training they get is designed and delivered in a way that better meets their needs. We will be looking carefully at how we can best do that. As set out in the five-year strategy, we are committed to incorporating the principles of the employer training&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 140&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;pilots within mainstream funding for adults, as a way of promoting a more demand-led approach. We will also continue to use the Learning and Skills Council&apos;s (LSC) annual business cycle to allocate public funds in a way that better matches our national skills priorities, including through the new level 2 entitlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11344"&gt;We will continue our drive to upgrade facilities in further education and training with an increase of 31 per cent in capital funding between 2004&amp;#x2013;05 and 2007&amp;#x2013;08. We will also bring local decision making and allocations for 16&amp;#x2013;19 capital provision into to alignment. Working with the department and other partners, the LSC will establish a single capital budget for new 16&amp;#x2013;19 provision across schools and FE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11345"&gt;The achievements of learners depend on the quality of the teaching and learning they receive, and the way in which their teachers and trainers are themselves trained, managed and supported. We will increase by &amp;#x00A3;70 million by 2007&amp;#x2013;08 our investment in initial training and continuous professional development for teachers, trainers, leaders and managers in colleges, work-based learning and adult and community learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11346"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Higher Education ( HE)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11347"&gt;Government expenditure on higher education will increase by around &amp;#x00A3;2 billion between 2004&amp;#x2013;05 and 2007&amp;#x2013;08, taking total investment to almost &amp;#x00A3;9.5 billion. This builds on the significant increases from 2002 Spending Review, and it confirms our commitment to stand by HE in future spending reviews, made in the HE White Paper and repeated during the discussions on the HE Bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11348"&gt;We will increase the HEFCE grant to allow for further increases in student numbers while maintaining the level of student funding per head in real terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11349"&gt;HE institutions will also benefit from increases in research funding: DfES recurrent funding for research will increase from &amp;#x00A3; 1.236 billion in 2005&amp;#x2013;06 to over &amp;#x00A3;1.4 billion in 2007&amp;#x2013;08&amp;#x2014; around 9 per cent in real terms. Our contribution to total UK science spending, together with the contribution from the Office of Science and Technology, will exceed &amp;#x00A3;5 billion by 2007&amp;#x2013;08.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11350"&gt;On top of all this, HE institutions will receive in full the extra income they generate from charging variable fees&amp;#x2014;in steady state (ie by 2010) this will be around &amp;#x00A3;1.2 billion extra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11351"&gt;HE institutions will start to receive this extra income in the academic year 2006&amp;#x2013;07. We expect the first tranche to be paid in two instalments&amp;#x2014;one half in early 2007, and the other before the end of the academic year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11352"&gt;Full-time students will benefit from an enhanced student support package:&#x000A;&lt;ul&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;An HE grant of up to &amp;#x00A3;2,700 for the poorest new students;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Enhanced bursaries, paid from HEIs&apos; new fee income stream;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Fee loans from 2006, for existing and new students;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0664P0I1076"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 141&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;A maintenance loan increased to the level of average student expenditure on essential items, for existing and new students;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Affordable repayments for student loans&amp;#x2014;9 per cent of salary above &amp;#x00A3; 15,000, for all students after April 2005. So students will make a contribution towards the cost of their higher education, but only when they can afford to do so;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;And for new students, a loan write-off after 25 years &amp;#x2014;that will particularly help those graduates who choose low-paid work.&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11353"&gt;Part-time students will also benefit from an enhanced package from this autumn. Grants for fees will replace loans and a new statutory fee grant will replace the old discretionary scheme. The poorest students will get &amp;#x00A3;825 in grants for fees and course costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11354"&gt;Overall, this spending review will help to put excellence in HE on a sustainable footing and will secure world class standards through:&#x000A;&lt;ul&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;increased teaching funding;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;increased research funding;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;increased fee income; and&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;better support for students.&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11355"&gt;This will enable us to make a significant impact on the funding gap we know exists, and to continue expansion on a sensible, properly funded basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11356"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Value for money and efficiency&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11357"&gt;The total investment in education and training is much larger than the figures presented here. Families have always invested and will continue to invest in their children&apos;s care and development. Employers invest in the training and development of their workforce. Support for education&amp;#x2014;in cash and in kind&amp;#x2014;is growing. We expect co-funding to grow over the spending review period, as individuals and employers become readier to invest in better education and training that meets their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11358"&gt;We must ensure that we get maximum value from every pound of additional investment for children and learners. Enabling people across the children, education and skills system to get better value for money from our investment in public services is our aim in the efficiency review. We have identified ways to achieve gains in value for money of &amp;#x00A3;4.3 billion over the spending review period. For example, we will:&#x000A;&lt;ul&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;reduce the number of Civil Service posts in the DfES and Ofsted by 1,960;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;enable front-line professionals in schools, colleges and higher education institutions to use their time more productively, enabling institutions to achieve more with their resources; for example through workforce reform, investment in ICT and reducing administrative burdens;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;improve procurement of goods, services and new school building, using a new procurement centre of excellence to strengthen procurement practice across the education and children&apos;s services sectors;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 142&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;streamline the delivery system for each sector through improvements in policy, funding and regulation, such as the lighter touch process for Ofsted inspection, streamlined data collection and reduced reporting and monitoring requirements introduced in the new relationship with schools.&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11359"&gt;In conclusion, this Statement sets out how we will use the additional resources for children and learners over the next three years to deliver the ambitious programme set out in the five-year strategy. I will be vigilant in ensuring that they are used efficiently and effectively. If resources are not being used to best effect, I will not hesitate to ensure they are switched to where they are most needed, and I will inform Parliament of any significant movements.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Children and Learners: Resources 2005–06 to 2007–08' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/sep/16/children-and-learners-resources-2005-06'></outline>

      <outline id='2551587' text='Lord Warner&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11362"&gt;My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Community (Dr Stephen Ladyman) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11363"&gt;I am reporting on progress with investigations into cases where individuals may have been inappropriately denied fully funded National Health Service care since 1996. These cases relate only to matters of past financial injustice and all claimants had access to care services and NHS treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11364"&gt;The majority of strategic health authorities (SHAs) have made considerable progress since December in the process of remedying any consequent financial injustice to patients (or the estates of such patients) who had wrongly been made to pay for the cost of their continuing care. In December, just over 22 per cent of cases received had been completed. Between December and March a substantial number of additional cases had been reported and by the end of March 57 per cent of cases had been completed. A percentage completion rate, of pre-31 March cases, of more than 85 per cent in July reflects the amount of work undertaken by all NHS and local authority personnel involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11365"&gt;The NHS has stressed the importance of all cases being investigated thoroughly and accurately and as such is committed to reviewing each application on its own merits. The process involved in undertaking an in depth review involves contact with many health and&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0664P0I1077"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 143&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;social care organisations and bodies, and as such there have been considerable delays in obtaining all the relevant records and patient data. In some cases data and information from aged cases have been lost and, wherever possible, they must be gathered from alternative sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11366"&gt;Delays should not automatically be attributed to the SHAs involved in particular cases. Occasionally the claimant themself is responsible for the delay. Many SHAs are now exceeding 95 per cent completion. In some cases, however, progress has been unsatisfactory, and the department will take up the matter directly with those SHAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0664P0-11367"&gt;In total, almost 20 per cent of cases have been granted recompense.
