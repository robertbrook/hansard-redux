          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0664P0-10915">On 11 June the Council of the European Union adopted Common Position 2004/510/CFSP. The Council adopted EC Regulation 1353/2004 on 27 July. These amend Common Position 2004/31/CFSP of 10 January and EC Regulation 131/2004 of 28 January, which renewed the arms embargo against Sudan and added an exemption for the supply of de-mining equipment. The new measures broaden the exemptions to the prohibition on the supply of arms, technical assistance<a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_72ws' title='Col. 72WS &mdash; HL Deb 07 September 2004 vol 664 c72WS' name='column_72ws' href='#column_72ws' rel='bookmark'>72WS</a>
          and financial assistance to include crisis management operations of the African Union. This allows EU member states to offer full practical and financial support to the deployment of the African Union's Ceasefire Commission to Darfur. With the support of her Majesty's Government, the United Nations Security Council on 30 July unanimously adopted Resolution 1556 (2004), which, inter alia imposes an arms embargo against non-governmental entities and individuals, including the Janjaweed, operating in the states of North Darfur, South Darfur and West Darfur in Sudan.</p><p id="S5LV0664P0-10916">With the support of Her Majesty's Government, the United Nations Security Council on 27 July 2004 unanimously adopted Resolution 1552 (2004) on the situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This renewed the arms embargo imposed by UNSCR 1493 (2003) for one year and extended the mandate of the UN Expert Group established by UNSCR 1533 (2004) to monitor the embargo for a further six months.</p><p id="S5LV0664P0-10917">With the support of Her Majesty's Government, the United Nations Security Council on 8 June unanimously adopted UN Security Council Resolution 1546 (2004). Among other measures, the resolution leaves the arms embargo in place, with new exemptions for arms and related materiel required by the Government of Iraq or the multinational force to serve the purposes of the resolution. The resolution passes all outstanding rights, responsibilities and obligations relating to the Oil for Food Programme to the Government of Iraq, including ensuring independently authenticated confirmation that goods have been delivered, and it leaves in place the financial sanctions upon former Government of Iraq funds and any funds belonging to Saddam Hussein, senior members of his regime and their immediate family members.</p><p id="S5LV0664P0-10918">On 26 April, the Council of the European Union adopted Common Position 2004/423/CFSP and EC Regulation 798/2004, concerning Burma. These renewed the restrictive measures imposed by Common Position 2003/297/CFSP from 30 April 2004 for a further 12 months, in view of the current political situation in Burma, notably the failure of the regime to pursue the process of national reconciliation, respect for human rights and democracy. The restrictive measures comprise an assets freeze and travel ban against members of the regime and others, an arms embargo, a prohibition on the attachment and hosting of military personnel to diplomatic missions, restrictions on development programmes and a suspension of high-level bilateral governmental visits to Burma.</p>
