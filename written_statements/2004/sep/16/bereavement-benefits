          <p class="first-para">Bereavement benefits were introduced on 9 April 2001, and for the first time extended support to both widows and widowers following the death of a spouse. These new benefits concentrate the help available where it is most needed; on immediate needs and on families with children.</p><p>Widowed parent's allowance is a weekly benefit payable to widowed parents who satisfy the qualifying conditions. The bereavement payment is a lump sum payment of &#x00A3;2,000 payable immediately to help with costs arising on bereavement. In addition, bereavement allowance is a weekly benefit payable, for 52 weeks following widowhood, to widows and widowers aged 45 and over without dependant children.</p><p>We have no plans to change these arrangements.</p>

          <p class="first-para">Staff who deal with bereavement benefits claims have extensive technical training on those benefits before commencing their job. The training includes both classroom lessons and computer based material. Although primarily aimed at staff who process benefit claims, the training can also assist Personal Advisors and Financial Assessors in gaining a comprehensive understanding of these benefits.</p><p>Additionally, further computer-based learning on the availability of bereavement benefits can be accessed by all staff who are likely to come into contact with, and give advice to, recently bereaved customers.</p><p>All staff dealing with customers have access to benefit guides, including guides on bereavement benefits.</p>
