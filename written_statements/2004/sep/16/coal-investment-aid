Most of this is expected to be drawn down by 31 March 2006. These offers leave a balance of around &#x00A3;2.5 million for further awards and to meet CIA administration costs.</p><p id="S5LV0664P0-11306">A summary of the period 2 awards is given below. More details will be published shortly on the DTI energy group website.</p>
