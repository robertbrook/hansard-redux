CSCS provides support to those clients whose applications were received before March 2003. CS2 provides support in handling both clients whose applications were received after 3 March 2003 or whose cases are in some relevant way linked to applications made after that date. EDS is meeting its contracted levels of service for CSCS. However, there are well documented defects within CS2 that have caused difficulties for clients. We are consequently withholding a proportion of the monthly payments for the service offered by CS2, under the terms of our contract with EDS. EDS is currently part way through a recovery programme intended to remove those defects.</p>
