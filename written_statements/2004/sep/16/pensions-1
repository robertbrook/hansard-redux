          <p class="first-para">The TUC has published new research showing which groups of employees have been the most likely to lose membership of a pensions scheme. We welcome the research that the TUC has undertaken on membership of occupational pensions. This draws substantively on data produced by the Government and underscores the importance of the measures we are taking forward through our pension reforms.</p><p>The <a href="/bills/pensions-bill">Pensions Bill</a> will rebuild confidence in occupational pensions, it will strengthen the partnership between employers, individuals and the state in pension provision. The introduction of the Pension Protection Fund (supported by a Pensions regulator) will enhance protection for pension scheme members. The Bill also protects employees transferring from one employer to another with a minimum level of pension provision. In

          addition it will encourage individuals to build up pension savings by offering a cash transfer sum when leaving a pension scheme.</p><p>Through our informed choice agenda we will work with our pension partners to explore and test different approaches aimed at maximising membership of employer-provided schemes. One of these is automatic enrolment where new employees automatically become members of their employer's pension scheme unless an individual opts out.</p><p>The TUC research does not contain specific information relating to Wales. However, based on the data that is available, Wales does not appear to be significantly different to the rest of the United Kingdom in terms of trends in occupational pensions.</p>

          <p class="first-para">Independent research commissioned by DWP which is soon to be published shows that there are very high levels of satisfaction among benefit and pensions customers who have transferred to direct payment and those who have started claiming and chose to receive direct payments. Overall 91 per cent. of customers were happy with the process of setting up direct payments (the figure for pensioners was 88 per cent.). Similarly, overall 93 per cent. of customers were happy with the process of having payments made into an account (the figure for pensioners was 92 per cent.).</p><p>The main benefits of direct payment were seen to be the increased convenience and security. Some people also feel it helps them manage their money more effectively. Most customers felt there were no disadvantages to receiving their benefit or pension by direct payment.</p><p>The full research report will be published shortly.</p>
