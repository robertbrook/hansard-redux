          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0664P0-11362">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Community (Dr Stephen Ladyman) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement today.</p><p id="S5LV0664P0-11363">I am reporting on progress with investigations into cases where individuals may have been inappropriately denied fully funded National Health Service care since 1996. These cases relate only to matters of past financial injustice and all claimants had access to care services and NHS treatment.</p><p id="S5LV0664P0-11364">The majority of strategic health authorities (SHAs) have made considerable progress since December in the process of remedying any consequent financial injustice to patients (or the estates of such patients) who had wrongly been made to pay for the cost of their continuing care. In December, just over 22 per cent of cases received had been completed. Between December and March a substantial number of additional cases had been reported and by the end of March 57 per cent of cases had been completed. A percentage completion rate, of pre-31 March cases, of more than 85 per cent in July reflects the amount of work undertaken by all NHS and local authority personnel involved.</p><p id="S5LV0664P0-11365">The NHS has stressed the importance of all cases being investigated thoroughly and accurately and as such is committed to reviewing each application on its own merits. The process involved in undertaking an in depth review involves contact with many health and

          social care organisations and bodies, and as such there have been considerable delays in obtaining all the relevant records and patient data. In some cases data and information from aged cases have been lost and, wherever possible, they must be gathered from alternative sources.</p><p id="S5LV0664P0-11366">Delays should not automatically be attributed to the SHAs involved in particular cases. Occasionally the claimant themself is responsible for the delay. Many SHAs are now exceeding 95 per cent completion. In some cases, however, progress has been unsatisfactory, and the department will take up the matter directly with those SHAs.</p><p id="S5LV0664P0-11367">In total, almost 20 per cent of cases have been granted recompense. As stated previously, the NHS
