          <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_1679ws' title='Col. 1679WS &mdash; HC Deb 16 September 2004 vol 424 c1679WS' name='column_1679ws' href='#column_1679ws' rel='bookmark'>1679WS</a>
          staff and visitors. A strategy document was issued to all Prison Service staff in June 2003. This explained the implications for prisons of the changes in the <a href="/acts/disability-discrimination-act-1995">Disability Discrimination Act</a> (DDA) due to come into effect on 1 October 2004.</p><p>The prison estate consists of a wide variety of buildings of differing ages and security levels and therefore access for prisoners to all prisons and prison facilities poses some difficulties. However the Prison Service's policy for all prisoners is to address their needs, including disability related needs, through the sentence planning process. This will allow prisons to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that prisoners are not discriminated against.</p><p>The Prison Service has significant experience of operating within the employment provisions of the DDA as non-operational staff have had protection since its first introduction. On 1 October, all operational staff will be covered by the DDA. Policies have been revised to ensure that the treatment for individual staff with disabilities is compliant with the employment aspects of the DDA.</p><p>A national disability compliance audit of all Prison Service establishments from a visitors' perspective has not been undertaken. Given the potential scope of the exercise this would not be practicable. It remains the responsibility of each establishment to address the individual requirements of those with particular needs, bearing in mind resource implications and reasonableness. Establishments and Visitors' Centres remain vigilant to the fact that the interpretation of disability within the <a href="/acts/disability-discrimination-act-1995">Disability Discrimination Act</a> is wide.</p>
