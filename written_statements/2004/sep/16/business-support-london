          grants are offered at the discretion of Government, to help businesses carry out research and development work that will lead to technologically innovative products or processes.</p><p>During 2003&#x2013;04, the DTI/Small Business Service made offers of grant to 145 London start-ups/SMEs. This represented funding in total of just under &#x00A3;9.5 million.</p><p>The planned restructuring of business support arrangements in London, that includes the transfer of BL4L contract management and direct delivery of GranD to the London Development Agency from April 2005, will further improve DTI services to customers within the Capital.</p><p>In 2003&#x2014;04, the LDA, which is primarily funded by the DTI:
          <q>Created or safeguarded 18,017 jobs (including those attributable to foreign direct investment and regional selective assistance);</q>
          <q>Set up or attracted 1,333 businesses to London;</q>
          <q>Provided support or advice to 26,937 businesses; and</q>
          <q>Created 26,683 learning opportunities</q></p><p>In 2003&#x2013;2004 the LDA invested over &#x00A3;350 million to create jobs, get people into work, support new and existing businesses and create space for businesses, homes and community facilities.</p><p>London businesses can also access a small suite of grants, loans guarantees and subsidised consultancy to address a range of business issues provided by the DTI. These include:</p><p><span class="italic">Succeeding through innovation:</span></p><p>Providing practical support for the key stages of innovation or research and development.

London businesses can access &#x00A3;50 million via the Regional Venture Capital Funds (RVCFs) o provide risk capital finance in amounts up to &#x00A3;500,000 to Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SMEs) who demonstrate growth potential.</p><p><span class="italic">Regional investment:</span></p><p>Encouraging investment in specific areas of England to promote economic regeneration. Selective Finance for Investment is designed for businesses that are looking at the possibility of investing in assisted areas.
