          <p class="first-para">The arrangements for public reporting of our progress towards sustainable development for the UK are being reviewed as part of the UK Government's consultation 'Taking it on: developing UK sustainable development strategy together'. This consultation closed on 31 July 2004. Defra, in partnership with other Government Departments, is currently considering the responses received, and we aim to launch the resulting new strategy, including a monitoring and reporting structure, next year.</p><p>The Government also reports annually on the management of its own land and buildings in the 'Sustainable Development in Government' Report; this provides an overview of departmental progress against targets in the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate. The Government has committed to review the framework during 2004&#x2013;05.</p>

          <p class="first-para">The UK Government, with Defra as overall lead department, reports annually on its progress towards sustainable development for the UK in the 'Achieving a better quality of life' series of reports. The most recent annual report, covering our actions and progress in 2003 and including updates for the 15 headline indicators of sustainable development, was published on 16 March 2004. A wider set of 147 indicators of sustainable development 'Quality of life counts' were published at the same time. In addition the headline indicators are updated on the Government's sustainable development website, as and when new data become available. These reporting arrangements are being reviewed as part of the consultation 'Taking it on: developing UK sustainable development strategy together'.</p><p>The Government also reports annually regarding the management of its own land and buildings in the 'Sustainable Development in Government' Report; this provides an overview of departmental progress against targets in the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate. The last report was published in November 2003.</p>
