The embargo includes humanitarian exemptions, exemptions for the United Nations operation in C&amp;#x00F4;te d&apos;Ivoire (UNOCI) and the French forces who support them and for states engaged in the evacuation of their nationals or those for whom they have consular responsibility in C&amp;#x00F4;te d&apos;Ivoire. There is also an exemption to allow support for the process of restructuring Ivorian defence and security forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-08811"&gt;Resolution 1572 (2004) also imposes a travel ban and assets freeze against all who constitute a threat to the peace and national reconciliation process in C&amp;#x00F4;te d&apos;Ivoire, which will come into effect on 15 December unless the Security Council decides that the signatories concerned have fully implemented their commitments under the Accra III agreement and are embarked towards full implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis agreement. I will inform the House if the travel ban and assets freeze come into force.&lt;/p&gt;' title="CÃ´te d'Ivoire: UN Sanctions" type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/dec/01/cote-divoire-un-sanctions'></outline>
