          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0667P0-09127">In December 2003, in the White Paper:<span class="italic">UK International Priorities: A Strategy for the FCO</span> (Cm 6052), my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr Jack Straw) set out the Government's international priorities for the next five to 10 years and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's strategy for delivering them in a world of new challenges, opportunities and threats.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-09128">On the basis of that strategy and the outcome of the 2004 spending round, we have been completing a reorganisation of the FCO in London and considering changes to our overseas network in order to align our resources more effectively to our priorities.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_85ws' title='Col. 85WS &mdash; HL Deb 15 December 2004 vol 667 c85WS' name='column_85ws' href='#column_85ws' rel='bookmark'>85WS</a><p id="S5LV0667P0-09129">This Statement concerns changes to the overseas network, aimed at enhancing our effectiveness in representing British interests abroad, and helping to deliver an efficient service on behalf of the British taxpayer.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-09130"><span class="italic">Context</span></p><p id="S5LV0667P0-09131">The FCO's overseas network currently comprises:
          <ul>
          <li>153 sovereign posts (embassies and high commissions) staffed by UK-based diplomats and local staff;</li>
          <li>70 subordinate posts (consulates general and consulates) reporting to an embassy or high commission; 10 missions to international organisations and conferences such as the UN, the EU and NATO; and resident governors in nine of the 14 overseas territories.</li>
          </ul></p><p id="S5LV0667P0-09132">Since 1997 we have made a series of changes in the overseas network to respond to changing priorities. UK-based staff numbers have grown by 9 per cent from about 5,600 in 1997 to about 6,100 now. We have opened 18 new sovereign and subordinate posts with UK-based staff since 1997, along with 13 locally staffed posts. Ten posts have been closed over the same period (excluding the announcements in this Statement). By comparison, France, with a network of almost identical size to our own, has since 2000 opened nine new posts and closed three. Germany today has 11 fewer posts than in 1997.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-09133">In the past three years the UK has opened major new missions in Baghdad, Basra, Kabul and Pyongyang (North Korea) in response to changing needs.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-09134">This Statement sets out some further changes to our overseas network. As with changes in the past, they reflect changing demands and challenges, and the need better to align our resources with our priorities, to maximise efficiency and to ensure that the UK has a cost-effective and flexible network of overseas representation.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-09135"><span class="italic">Sovereign Posts</span></p><p id="S5LV0667P0-09136">We intend to close eight sovereign posts with UK-based staff, and one locally-staffed post (Tarawa, Kiribati).

Experience for example in our posts in Italy has shown that fully localised posts are able to deliver services in a cost-efficient, professional and effective way under the strategic direction of the superintending embassy; and our plans extend that model elsewhere. We expect political work to be carried out mainly in capitals, except in large, federal countries like the USA.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-09142">We propose moving to locally engaged staff in only 11 posts. And we plan to close 10 subordinate posts altogether. Changes are set out in the following table, together with details of how the network in each country will look after these changes have been made.

          investment to the UK, and reinforcing support for British businesses in important emerging markets, such as China, where government support makes a real difference to business, and where very strong economic growth means enormous opportunities. My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer's recent announcement of the establishment of an Asia task force will build on this strategy.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-09147">To provide the resources for these new activities, UKTI has decided to take a number of steps better to match resources to demand. Commercial services in a number of smaller markets are being re-organised. In the UK's smallest overseas markets, UKTI services themselves in FCO posts covering these markets will be withdrawn, although support and advice from UKTI's website and from its teams in London will still be available. And, importantly, political support and lobbying by ambassadors and high commissioners in support of British business in these markets will continue to be available everywhere.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-09148"><span class="italic">Timing and savings</span></p><p id="S5LV0667P0-09149">We plan to have implemented all these changes before the end of 2006. The main savings from the package will be in staff and running costs, including rentals. There will be some one-off costs, including for redundancy. But once these have been met, overall savings should amount to around &#x00A3;6 million per annum as a contribution to the FCO's overall efficiency target of &#x00A3;86 million. (A further &#x00A3;0.5 million of savings are part of our efficiency plan for the 2002 spending review). There will be some revenue from asset sales, although these will take time to realise.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-09150">The savings made will help to underpin higher-priority work in line with the FCO's strategic priorities, including on counter proliferation, counter-terrorism, energy and climate change. Some of the savings will also be redeployed to strategic priority work within certain regions where we are closing posts. In Africa, for instance, we plan to create new jobs to cover these issues across the region, with a new post in Nairobi to help support our work on climate change, one in Nigeria to cover energy, and one in Pretoria to cover regional issues more generally as well as covering Maseru and Mbabane.</p>
