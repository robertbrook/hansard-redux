          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0667P0-08978">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Defence (Mr Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_60ws' title='Col. 60WS &mdash; HL Deb 09 December 2004 vol 667 c60WS' name='column_60ws' href='#column_60ws' rel='bookmark'>60WS</a><p id="S5LV0667P0-08979">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence informed the House in his Statement on 21 July (<span class="italic">Official Report,</span> Commons, 21/7/04; col. 348.) that changes in the force structure of the RAF and the achievement of planned organisational efficiencies would lead to a reduced RAF trained manpower requirement of around 41,000 by 2008. I can now inform the House that the RAF has completed initial work on how that reduction will be achieved, while maintaining a satisfactory balance of personnel with the skills and experience levels throughout the service to enable the delivery of operational capability in a more flexible, deployable and responsive way.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08980">The RAF will achieve the required reduction from a current regular trained strength of around 48,900 through a balanced strategy of normal outflow, reduced recruitment and a targeted redundancy programme. The service is therefore reducing its recruitment targets by some 4,000&#x2014;to around 6,000 in total&#x2014;over the next three financial years and has identified a need for some 2,750 redundancies over the same period. Redundancy will be effected by a compulsory scheme, for which applications will be invited. It is hoped that as many of the redundancies as possible will be applicants but, in order to ensure the long-term balance of ability and experience across the RAF, it may not be possible to accept all applications received, in which case it may be necessary to select some non-applicants.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08981">Applications for the first 450 redundancies are being invited today and those selected will leave the service by 31 March 2006. Details of the remaining redundancies&#x2014;approximately 2,300&#x2014;which are expected to be managed in two further phases, will be notified to RAF personnel when further work is complete.</p>
