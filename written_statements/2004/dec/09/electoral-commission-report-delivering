          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0667P0-08991">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Local and Regional Government has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08992">My right honourable friends the Deputy Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs are jointly publishing today the government response to the Electoral Commission's report, <span class="italic">Delivering Democracy?</span></p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08993">In its report, the commission set out its evaluation of the electoral pilots in June 2004. It found that the elections were successfully delivered; there was no evidence that all-postal voting led to an increase in fraud; and a majority of more than 2:1 were either very or fairly satisfied with the all-postal voting arrangement in their pilot area.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08994">The commission also found that voters wanted to have choice about the way in which they vote. That is consistent with the Government's long-term goal of multi-channel elections, including voters having the options of electronic, postal voting and voting in person.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08995">We are not, however, persuaded by the commission's arguments that all-postal voting should not be pursued at UK elections. They are not supported by the outcome of the June elections, where turnout was substantially higher in the pilot regions and a large majority found the all-postal method acceptable. Furthermore, the turnout achieved in the north-east regional referendum underlined the value of all-postal voting in increasing participation.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08996">In its report, the commission proposes the development of a new model of voting. We welcome the opportunity to contribute to that work and will have regard to the progress of the work when assessing any new proposals for all-postal voting.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08997">The Electoral Commission also indicated that it would not support pilots in May 2005&#x2014;or any at all until the new model was in use. We have decided not to issue a prospectus inviting applications for pilots in the county council elections in May 2005. It remains, however, open any time, to local authorities to apply

          to run all-postal pilots. The Government remain committed to a programme of electoral pilots in 2006 and subsequent years, including e-voting pilots.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08998">We hope that the publication of this response will substantially move forward the modernisation agenda for elections.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08999">Copies of this government response to the Electoral Commission's report will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
