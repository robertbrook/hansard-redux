          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0667P0-09249">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Health (Mr Hutton) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_106ws' title='Col. 106WS &mdash; HL Deb 20 December 2004 vol 667 c106WS' name='column_106ws' href='#column_106ws' rel='bookmark'>106WS</a><p id="S5LV0667P0-09250">The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council met on 6 and 7 December. Items on the agenda relating to health were covered on 6 December. Items for discussion were: a co-ordinated approach to combat HIV/AIDS in the European Union and its neighbourhood; European Commission proposals for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on medicinal products for paediatric use; and the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on nutrition and health claims made on foods. I represented the United Kingdom.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-09251">Ministers welcomed the European Commission's approach, as set out in its working paper <span class="italic">A Co-ordinated Approach to Combat HIV/AIDS in the EU and its Neighbourhood,</span> but agreed that further work would be needed at all levels. The UK called on the European Commission to provide a clearer picture of where EU resources were currently targeted on HIV/AIDS and an analysis of how effective these investments had been. The UK stressed the need for the EU to work closely with the Global Fund. The UK also stressed its commitment to working with member states to develop a vaccine following the announcement in the UK on World. AIDS Day (1 December) on exploring the use of advance purchase agreements to create the right financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies to invest in research.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-09252">The Council discussed, for the first time, the European Commission proposed regulation on paediatric medicines. The European Commission presented the proposal, setting out the principal objective of improving the health of the children of Europe by increasing the development of medicines for use in children. The UK did not intervene.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-09253">The Council had its first discussion of the Commission's proposal to harmonise rules for labelling foodstuffs with health and nutrition claims. The Council's exchange of views was structured around presidency questions focused on the key issue of nutrient profiles, the proposed method of determining whether claims should be allowed. The UK's position was that the impact on business had to be proportionate to the objectives, and that full stakeholder consultations on the details of implementation would be needed.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-09254">Ministers adopted Council conclusions on a European response to emerging zoonotic diseases without any discussion.</p>
