      <outline id='2541525' text='The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean)&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09280"&gt;Noble Lords will wish to be aware of the outcome of the recent discussions in Geneva on the two subjects set for discussion by states party to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) in 2004. States party were mandated to discuss and promote common understanding and effective action on strengthening national and international efforts and existing mechanisms for the surveillance, detection, diagnosis and combating of infectious diseases affecting humans, animals and plants; and on promoting common understanding and effective action on the effects of cases of alleged use of biological or toxin weapons or suspicious outbreaks of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09281"&gt;On the concluding day of the meeting of states party to the BTWC, which took place from 6&amp;#x2013;10 December, there was agreement by consensus on a politically binding report where, inter alia, states party recognised the international aspect of these subjects and their relevance to the object and purpose of the BTWC, and agreed on the value of the following actions:&#x000A;&lt;ul&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;supporting the existing networks of relevant international organisations for the surveillance, detection, diagnosis and combating of infectious diseases and acting to strengthen the World Health Organisation (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) programmes, within their mandates, for the continued development and strengthening of, and research into, rapid, effective and reliable activities for the surveillance, detection, diagnosis and combating of infectious diseases, including in cases of emergencies of international concern;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;improving, wherever possible, national and regional disease surveillance capabilities, and, if in a position to do so, assisting and encouraging, with the necessary agreement, other states party to do the same;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;working to improve communication on disease surveillance, including with the WHO, FAO and OIE, and among states party;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;continuing to develop their own national capacities for response, investigation and mitigation, in cooperation with the relevant international and regional organisations, and, if in a position to do so, assisting and encouraging, with the necessary agreement, other states party to do the same;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;the Sixth Review Conference in 2006 considering, inter alia, the further development of current procedures for the provision of assistance, by&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 112&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;those in a position to do so, to states party in cases of alleged use of biological weapons or suspicious outbreaks of disease.&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09282"&gt;The preceeding Meeting of Experts held in Geneva in July had prepared the way for this political decision making. At this earlier meeting, levels of attendance and participation were excellent with 87 states party contributing to international discussion and sharing of expertise on these subjects. For the United Kingdom experts from across Whitehall made nine presentations which were well received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09283"&gt;That so many other states party sent experts from capitals and took an active part is an indication to us that delegations recognised both the importance of the two subjects and also the value of the work programme more generally in contributing to strengthening the BTWC. The success of the July meeting was reinforced at the December meeting of states party where states party in their national statements, welcomed the substantial exchange of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09284"&gt;The United Kingdom was grateful to the Chair, Mr Peter Goosen of South Africa, for the efforts he made to achieve consensus on a report that reflected the commonality of views and approaches that were demonstrated at the meetings. We believe that this has again demonstrated to the wider arms control community that the intersessional process has value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09285"&gt;The continued success of this process is particularly important to the UK as we look ahead to 2005 and our own chairmanship of the meetings of states party. Ambassador John Freeman, UK Permanent Representative to the Conference on Disarmament, was elected on the final day of this year&apos;s meeting as the chair. The subject for consideration will be "the content, promulgation, and adoption of codes of conduct for scientists". UK national preparations for this began in 2003. We have held a series of seminars with representatives of academia, NGOs and industry to seek their views and to assist in developing our ideas for next year. Ambassador Freeman wrote to states party on the final day of the 2004 meeting with some initial thoughts on the work ahead. The UK will continue to work co-operatively both nationally and internationally through 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09286"&gt;I will keep the House informed of developments and outcomes in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Biological Weapons Convention' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/dec/21/biological-weapons-convention'></outline>

      <outline id='2541541' text='Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09287"&gt;During his oral answer to the right honourable Member for Devizes (Mr Michael Ancram) on 14 December 2004 (&lt;i&gt;Official Report,&lt;/i&gt; col. 1515), my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr Jack Straw) said the following.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09288"&gt;"Following an initiative by my predecessor, my right honourable friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), we now have a legally enforceable EU code of conduct on arms sales".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09289"&gt;We would like to clarify this statement. The Code of Conduct, as incorporated into the Consolidated EU&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0667P0I0964"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 113&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria, serves as binding statutory guidance to the Government in our assessment of application for strategic export licences under Section 9(5) of the Export Control Act. The Government is therefore required to have regard to the criteria set out in the Code when assessing such applications. Export licensing decisions may be subject to judicial review, including on the basis of failure to have proper regard to such criteria. However, the Code of Conduct is not per se directly legally enforceable before the UK or European courts.&lt;/p&gt;' title='EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/dec/21/eu-code-of-conduct-on-arms-exports'></outline>

The guidance contained in the circular should result in a greater proportion of this need being provided for on sites allocated in development plans, providing greater certainty both for Gypsies and Travellers and local residents and reducing the need for local authorities to enter into lengthy and expensive enforcement actions against unauthorised sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09294"&gt;The new circular also updates the definition of Gypsies and Travellers to reflect the fact that many stop travelling permanently or temporarily because of health reasons or caring responsibilities but still want to maintain their traditional lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09295"&gt;The consultation will run until 18 March 2005.

The following guidance sets out procedures for dealing with complaints about the handling of requests for information. The guidance makes it clear that there should be no inconsistencies between the provision of information in answer to Parliamentary Questions and information given to citizens under the Freedom of Information Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S5LV0667P0I0965"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 115&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09304"&gt;Where a Member is dissatisfied with the Answer to a Parliamentary Question, there are well established parliamentary routes that Members may follow, such as tabling further Questions; raising the issues on the Adjournment; or a complaint to the Public Administration Committee, which may seek to follow up the issue with Ministers. Alternatively, Members may write to the appropriate Minister expressing their concern and setting out the information that they are seeking. Such correspondence shall be treated by departments as a new request for information requiring a full internal review and fresh decision. The request will attract all the provisions and appeal mechanisms afforded by the Freedom of Information Act, including if necessary, an appeal to the Information Commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09305"&gt;Any investigation by the Information Commissioner will therefore be related to the correspondence to the Minister and not extend to the Answer to the Parliamentary Question or to any other parliamentary proceedings, which are protected by parliamentary privilege. In addition, the Cabinet Office plans to issue revised guidance to officials on drafting Answers to Parliamentary Questions taking account of the Freedom of Information Act.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Parliamentary Questions and the Freedom of Information Act' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/dec/21/parliamentary-questions-and-the-freedom'></outline>

In July this year, Laser approached the department with a proposal that an agreed termination of the PFI project represented the best available option for resolving those difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09311"&gt;DTI has now agreed with Laser and their lenders to the termination of the PFI project on the following basis. The department has made a termination payment of &amp;#x00A3;75 million, based on the principles of the termination provisions of the project agreement. That means that full ownership of and responsibility for the new facilities, which have an insurance value of &amp;#x00A3;120 million, have been transferred back to DTI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09312"&gt;Following the termination payment, net liabilities of &amp;#x00A3;73 million on DTI&apos;s balance sheet will be extinguished, and the department will make significant cash savings from fees that would otherwise have been made in payment for the new facilities between now and 2023. This is an example of how the risk transfer principles of PFI arrangements can operate, with appropriate risks being ultimately transferred to the private sector to the benefit of the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09313"&gt;DTI intends, wherever possible, to put to competitive tender the construction work needed to complete the facilities. DTI has also exercised its right to step into, in place of Laser, the support services management agreement made between Laser and Serco Limited for the provision by Serco of support services at the site, thereby ensuring uninterrupted provision of those services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0667P0-09314"&gt;The DTI is confident that the arrangements will enable the outstanding work on the new facilities to be completed so that NPL can continue to deliver world-class science and vital support for innovation, consistent with value for money for the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;' title='National Physical Laboratory' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/dec/21/national-physical-laboratory'></outline>
