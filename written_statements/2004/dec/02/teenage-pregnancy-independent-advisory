          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0667P0-08845">My right honourable friend the Minister for Children (Margaret Hodge) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08846">The Independent Advisory Group on Teenage Pregnancy has published its third annual report today, 11 November 2004. This is a very thorough and considered report which continues to build on the group's previous two annual reports. We commend the independent advisory group for the notable contribution it has made since it was formed. We welcome the advisory group's acknowledgement of the significant progress made to date nationally, regionally and locally on implementing our teenage pregnancy strategy. We recognise that we are at a critical point of this 10-year strategy, the goals of which can be achieved only by sustaining the drive and energy we have demonstrated so far. Our continued commitment to addressing this key inequality and public health issue is signalled by our PSA jointly held with the Department of Health. Reducing teenage pregnancies and supporting young parents is central to our change for children programme with its aim of improving the life chances for all young people.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08847">The report contains eight recommendations on potential areas for further action. Each recommendation will receive our full and careful consideration and a detailed government response will be published by March 2005. A copy of the independent advisory group's third annual report has been placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
