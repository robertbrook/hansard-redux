          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0667P0-08832">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Defence (Mr Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08833">As part of the routine management of UK forces in the Multinational Division (South-East) (MND(SE)) in Iraq, we intend to conduct a roulement of forces involving the replacement of 40 Commando Royal Marines with the 2nd Battalion the Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08834">The Secretary of State for Defence announced on 17 June (<span class="italic">Official Report,</span> Commons, col. 48) that 40 Commando would deploy to MND(SE) during June and July, both to provide support to Iraqi security forces and to provide the capacity for some other tasks, including the protection of essential infrastructure. The general officer commanding MND(SE) has concluded that there will be a continuing requirement for these tasks beyond elections in Iraq planned for 30 January. Based on this advice, we have decided that 2nd Battalion the Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment should replace 40 Commando when their six-month deployment in Iraq comes to an end in January 2005.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08835">Since 1 November, 2nd Battalion the Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment has been acting as the very high readiness reserve (VHRR), at 10 days' readiness to deploy to Iraq. In January the responsibility for VHRR will pass from 2nd Battalion the Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment to the 1st Battalion the Royal Scots.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08836">The roulement is currently planned to take place from early January 2005, with handover to 2nd Battalion the Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment complete by mid January. We expect that the number of Armed Forces personnel in theatre will remain broadly the same as a result of these changes, with the other major UK units currently in Iraq unchanged. These units are as follows:
          <ul>
          <li>4 Armoured Brigade Headquarters and Signal Squadron,</li>
          <li>The Queen's Dragoon Guards,</li>
          <li>The Royal Dragoon Guards,</li>
          <li>4th Regiment Royal Artillery,</li>
          <li>1st Battalion Scots Guards,</li>
          <li>1st Battalion Welsh Guards,</li>
          <li>1st Battalion The Duke of Wellington's Regiment and</li>
          <li>21 Engineer Regiment.</li>
          </ul></p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08837">I would emphasise that these are routine adjustments to UK forces in MND(SE). We continue to consider, with our partners in the multinational force, the levels and dispositions of forces required in Iraq in the months ahead, to support the sovereign Interim Government of Iraq through the process leading to the election of an Iraqi Transitional Government and Assembly in

          January 2005 and full constitutional elections in December 2005. If we judge that further changes to the UK military contribution in Iraq would be appropriate to support this process, we will of course inform the House at the earliest opportunity. At present, however, no such decision has been made.</p>
