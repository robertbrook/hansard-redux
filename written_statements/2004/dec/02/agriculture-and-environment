          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0667P0-08848">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08849">A report on the review of the Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission (AEBC) has been published today. The review has been conducted by an independent reviewer, Dr Neil Williams, in line with the Cabinet Office guidance for reviewing non-departmental public bodies. Its main recommendation is that the AEBC should be wound up by the end of the current financial year.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08850">Ministerial colleagues involved in the funding of the AEBC and I are grateful for this report. We accept the advice of the review committee, that the report should be published as soon as possible and with minimal comment from Ministers. We would like to express our thanks and support for work that the AEBC has carried out since its creation four years ago. We acknowledge the dedication of its members. The contribution of its chairman, Professor Malcolm Grant, has been key to everything the commission has so far achieved.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_36ws' title='Col. 36WS &mdash; HL Deb 02 December 2004 vol 667 c36WS' name='column_36ws' href='#column_36ws' rel='bookmark'>36WS</a><p id="S5LV0667P0-08851">We now intend to consider the recommendations of the independent review very carefully, and aim to reach a decision shortly. We will, however, ensure that we engage with stakeholders prior to making decisions on the future of the AEBC or a successor body.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08852">I have written to the chairman of the AEBC asking the commission to continue to carry out its current work programme but to bear in mind the review's recommendations.</p><p id="S5LV0667P0-08853">The Science and Technology Select Committee, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee and the Environmental Audit Select Committee have been sent copies of this report. It has also been sent to the chair, deputy chair and members of the AEBC, learned societies and other stakeholders and I have placed copies in the Libraries of both Houses. An electronic version of the report has been placed on the Office of Science and Technology website at: <span class="underline">http://www.ost.gov.uk/policy/bodies/review.htm).</span></p>
