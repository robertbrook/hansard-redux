          <p class="first-para">I am pleased to announce that 13 bids from across the public and voluntary sectors have been successful in round six of the Invest to Save Budget at a cost of &#x00A3;46 million in total over the three years to 2006&#x2013;07 for England. The allocated sum rises to &#x00A3;51 million to include consequential funding for the devolved Administrations. The attached table describes the winners of this round.</p><p>The Invest to Save Budget (ISB) is a joint Treasury/Cabinet Office initiative. It provides support for projects which increase the extent of joint working between different parts of government, identify innovative ways of delivering public services and reduce the cost of delivering the services and/or improve the quality and effectiveness of services delivered to the public. This is the sixth round of the ISB which started in 1999.</p><p>It is expected that a total of around &#x00A3;370 million will be spent on ISB projects over the period from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2006. Round one was restricted to central Government Departments and their agencies. In the second and third rounds local authorities, police and fire authorities, health authorities, non-departmental public bodies and public corporations could also apply. In the fourth round, voluntary sector bodies were able to apply for the first time. The fifth round built on the partnership theme and encouraged the risk adverse public sector to innovate. The sixth round continues to seek out projects to improve delivery of public services through innovation and partnership working.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_39ws' title='Col. 39WS &mdash; HC Deb 04 February 2004 vol 417 c39WS' name='column_39ws' href='#column_39ws' rel='bookmark'>39WS</a><p>Winning projects have to agree an implementation plan with the sponsor departments. Each project has to provide six-monthly progress reports and carry out an evaluation of its success once it has been completed. Wider dissemination of the good practice from completed projects is then fed back into the whole spectrum of public service providers.</p><p>
