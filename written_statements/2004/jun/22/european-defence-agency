          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0662P0-07255">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Geoffrey Hoon) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07256">The General Affairs and External Relations Council of the European Union agreed on 14 June to the establishment of a European Defence Agency in the fields of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments. The agency will make a major contribution to the development of the military capability of EU member states, a key UK objective for the European security and defence policy. By rationalising and harmonizing capability requirements, and linking those directly to industrial and research efforts, it will help to improve the military effectiveness of European nations which will benefit both the EU and NATO. The work of the agency will be directed by a steering board consisting of national Defence Ministers to ensure that it is subject to appropriate national control as well as being given the necessary political impetus.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07257">The Government regret that it was necessary to agree to the establishment of the agency, through a scrutiny override, before parliamentary scrutiny had been completed and before the debate, recommended by the European Scrutiny Committee on 9 June (22nd report, 2003&#x2013;04, HC42-xxii), could be held. The United Kingdom did not wish to prevent the decision to establish the agency being taken at the Council meeting given the benefits expected from the creation

          of the agency and the influential role played by the United Kingdom in shaping and implementing its formation. I wrote to the Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee on 10 June setting out this position. The Government are, none the less, fully committed to the need for national parliaments to have proper oversight of EU issues and the establishment of the European Defence Agency will be debated in European Standing Committee B on 22 June.</p>
