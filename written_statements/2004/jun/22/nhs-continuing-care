          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0662P0-07276">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Community (Dr Stephen Ladyman) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement today.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_59ws' title='Col. 59WS &mdash; HL Deb 22 June 2004 vol 662 c59WS' name='column_59ws' href='#column_59ws' rel='bookmark'>59WS</a><p id="S5LV0662P0-07277">I am publishing today figures that detail the progress made on investigations into cases where individuals may have been inappropriately denied National Health Service care.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07278">Strategic health authorities have been required to investigate cases where individuals may have been inappropriately denied fully funded NHS continuing care since 1996. Where investigations have revealed that care should have been provided the NHS has been recompensing, or will recompense, individuals for the cost of that care. This process has formed part of the department's response to the Health Service Ombudsman's report into long-term care, which was published in February 2003.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07279">The process began with each SHA reviewing and aligning the criteria for NHS continuing care within its area and ensuring that these criteria conformed with the legal position.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07280">The department requested that investigations, as far as possible, were completed by 31 March 2004. The number and complex nature of new cases presenting themselves during the three months from January to March 2004 posed significant challenges to meeting that deadline, but the NHS has remained committed to completing investigations as accurately and thoroughly as possible. At the end of March the NHS had completed 57 per cent. (6,713) of all outstanding investigations. This number is greater than the number of cases which the NHS was aware of at the end of December 2003, and demonstrates the NHS's commitment to completing cases promptly once they are received. The department will check that those cases outstanding at the end of March have been completed as of the end of July. From then onwards I will expect any cases to be completed within two months of all the information on the case being received by the SHA. The situation in each SHA is summarised in the table.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07281">Following the work carried out by SHAs in reviewing, revising and investigating the provision of fully funded NHS continuing care, awareness and application by the NHS is improving. The NHS expects to pay a total of over &#x00A3;180 million when all the cases received by the end of March 2004 have been investigated and restitution made for incorrect decisions. There is a timely appeal process for current cases, so that the need for a retrospective recompense process will decline.
