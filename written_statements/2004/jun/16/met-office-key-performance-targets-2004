          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0662P0-07125">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07126">The chief executive of the Met Office is responsible for providing meteorological and related environmental services, including climate change prediction, to a wide range of customers, including the Armed Forces, government departments and local authorities, civil aviation, shipping, emergency services, media, commerce, industry and the general public. The Met Office also undertakes research related to meteorology and climate.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07127">Over the past 12 months the Met Office completed the challenging relocation of its headquarters and operations centre from Bracknell to Exeter. It was one of the biggest moves of IT capability undertaken in Europe, with no interruption in output or customer service. Some 1,000 staff transferred to Exeter in a project that was completed on time, to budget and against quality standards set. The move to new premises supports new ways of working and an advanced technology and IT infrastructure, which will result in increased resilience and data reliability for the Met Office's customers.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_31ws' title='Col. 31WS &mdash; HL Deb 16 June 2004 vol 662 c31WS' name='column_31ws' href='#column_31ws' rel='bookmark'>31WS</a><p id="S5LV0662P0-07128">To reflect the established strategy of investment and growth, the Met Office has adopted a new target relating to growth. A new target has also been included to ensure that the Met Office is prepared for the implementation of the <a href="/acts/freedom-of-information-act-2000">Freedom of Information Act 2000</a> on 1 January 2005.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07129">Previously the Met Office has had a target set against commercial contribution. This has become less relevant given that there is no longer a clear distinction between commercial work and public sector work. This target has therefore been discontinued.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07130">Key Target 1: To achieve an increase in value for the numerical weather prediction index (measuring forecasting skill) of at least 1.4 by 31 March 2005, from the level achieved at 31 March 2004.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07131">Key target 2: To deliver an operating profit before strategic investments of at least &#x00A3;15.5 million in the financial year 2004&#x2013;05, while making strategic investments of between &#x00A3;5.8 million and &#x00A3;6.8 million.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07132">Key target 3: To achieve a return on capital employed of at least 3.5 per cent in the financial year 2004&#x2013;05.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07133">Key target 4: To achieve direct services growth in both government and non-government revenue of at least 4.1 per cent in the financial year 2004&#x2013;05 from the 2003&#x2013;04 baseline, while maintaining direct services operating profit.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_32ws' title='Col. 32WS &mdash; HL Deb 16 June 2004 vol 662 c32WS' name='column_32ws' href='#column_32ws' rel='bookmark'>32WS</a><p id="S5LV0662P0-07134">Key target 5: To have in place, by 31 December 2004, basic procedures to answer requests for information under the <a href="/acts/freedom-of-information-act-2000">Freedom of Information Act 2000</a> and to review by 31 March 2005 the initial operation of the procedures to ensure that they are fit for purpose.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07135">Key target 6: To develop, by March 2005, an efficiency measure which demonstrates the continuous improvement in value for money of the National Met Service (including the Public Met Service and relevant parts of the National Met Programme).</p>
