          <p class="first-para">The business review of the defence vetting process has been completed. The review team has made a number of recommendations and observations, which Director General (security and safety) has agreed and endorsed, and as the senior responsible officer will oversee the implementation strategy.</p><p>The key findings of the review are that the rationalisation of the former defence vetting organisations has been successful, providing both economies and efficiencies in the vetting process and offering opportunities for further performance enhancement and business expansion. The Defence Vetting Agency (DVA) has achieved the prime aim required by its framework document and become an integrated and cohesive organisation. Standardised procedures for defence vetting have been adopted by the agency, which has successfully consolidated the majority of the disparate processes previously used within the separate service vetting organisations. The organisation is correctly sized to deliver its required output and over the period 1997&#x2013;98 to 2002&#x2013;03 has reduced its net operating costs from &#x00A3;11 million to &#x00A3;9.6 million, with the staff component reducing by &#x00A3;1.8 million.</p><p>The review also concluded that the DVA should remain a defence agency and, as the largest UK vetting organisation, is well placed to extend its services to a wider range of other Government Departments, if required.</p><p>I have arranged for copies of the report of the business review to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p><p>Key targets have now been set for the chief executive of the DVA for the financial year 2004&#x2013;05. Building upon the progress made since it formed in 1997, these incremental targets will help the agency to become much
