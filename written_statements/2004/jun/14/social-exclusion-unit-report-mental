          <cite class='member author entry-title'><a href="/people/mr-jeff-rooker" title="Mr Jeff Rooker">The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (Lord Rooker)</a></cite>
          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0662P0-07047">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_19ws' title='Col. 19WS &mdash; HL Deb 14 June 2004 vol 662 c19WS' name='column_19ws' href='#column_19ws' rel='bookmark'>19WS</a><p id="S5LV0662P0-07048">In spring 2003, my right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister asked the Social Exclusion Unit to consider what more could be done to reduce social exclusion among adults of working age with mental health problems. The unit has looked in particular at promoting employment and job retention and improving social participation and access to services for this group.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07049">Adults with mental health problems are one of the most excluded groups in society. Fewer than a quarter of adults with long-term mental health problems are in employment, despite many having aspirations to work. Too often people do not have other activities to fill their days and spend their time alone. Stigma and discrimination against people with mental health problems remain widespread, and can have a greater impact on the quality of people's lives than the mental health problems themselves.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07050">Depression, anxiety and phobias can affect up to one in six of the population at any one time, with the highest rates in deprived neighbourhoods. Severe mental health problems, such as schizophrenia, are relatively rare, affecting around one in 200 adults each year. The costs of mental health problems can be high, both to individuals and society as a whole. In addition to medical costs, lost opportunities to work can lead to a negative spiral of debt, reliance on benefits and housing instability. Early intervention to keep people in work and maintain social contacts can significantly reduce these costs.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07051">The Social Exclusion Unit report, <span class="italic">Mental Health and Social Exclusion,</span> is published today. For the first time, action will be taken across government to address the full range of issues affecting people with mental health problems. Rather than focusing solely on medical needs, it addresses stigma and discrimination, employment, education, housing, family needs and community participation. At national level, more than 20 government departments, agencies and other national organisations will be involved in driving forward the report's action plan in six key areas:
          <ul>
          <li>stigma and discrimination&#x2014;a sustained programme to challenge negative attitudes and promote awareness of people's rights;</li>
          <li>the role of health and social care in tackling social exclusion&#x2014;implementing evidence-based practice in vocational services and enabling reintegration into the community;</li>
          <li>employment&#x2014;giving people with mental health problems a real chance of sustained paid work reflecting their skills and experience;</li>
          <li>taking part in the local community&#x2014;enabling people to lead fulfilling lives the way they choose;</li>
          <li>getting the basics right&#x2014;access to decent homes, financial advice and transport; and</li>
          <li>making it happen&#x2014;clear arrangements for leading this programme and maintaining momentum.</li>
          </ul></p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07052">The SEU report builds on action already taken by the Government to improve services for people with mental health problems, including the modernisation
          <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_20ws' title='Col. 20WS &mdash; HL Deb 14 June 2004 vol 662 c20WS' name='column_20ws' href='#column_20ws' rel='bookmark'>20WS</a>
          of NHS mental health services, improved civil rights for disabled people and more support to help disabled people back to work. It draws on examples of local good practice, often led by an expert and innovative voluntary sector.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07053">Creating sustainable, inclusive communities is about everyone having a stake. Being in work and having social contacts is strongly associated with improved health and well-being. People with mental health problems have much to offer. If they are able to fulfil their potential, the impact of mental health problems on individuals, their families and society can be significantly reduced.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07054">A copy of the Social Exclusion Unit report, <span class="italic">Mental Health and Social Exclusion,</span> and a summary document are available in the Libraries of the House.</p>
