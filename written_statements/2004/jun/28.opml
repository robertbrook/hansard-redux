      <outline id='2537055' text="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills (Baroness Ashton of Upholland):&lt;p&gt; My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Mr Charles Clarke) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have today placed in the Library of the House copies of a booklet outlining the steps we are proposing to take in response to &lt;i&gt;Making Mathematics Count,&lt;/i&gt; the report of the post-14 mathematics inquiry chaired by Professor Adrian Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report was published on 24 February and at that time I publicly welcomed it. Over the past few months I have been considering the recommendations very carefully, with advice from Adrian Smith and key partners in England, and now feel I am in a position to announce how I plan to take forward the key elements of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response applies to England only. The devolved administrations of Wales and Northern Ireland are considering the report's recommendations and developing their own responses. The report did not make specific recommendations for Scotland but the Scottish Executive will take the analysis of policy and provision into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposals address the four key areas identified in Adrian Smith's report: the supply of mathematics teachers, supporting teachers' continuing professional development, curriculum pathways, assessment and qualifications, and providing strategic leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My proposals for strategic leadership include the appointment of a chief adviser on mathematics within the DfES to oversee implementation of the mathematics strategy and to raise the profile of the subject. Anita Straker of the Centre for British Teachers has been appointed on an interim basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My proposals to improve the supply and retention of teachers include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;raising the value of the teacher training bursary for mathematics graduates from &amp;#x00A3;6,000 to &amp;#x00A3;7,000 from September 2005;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;increasing the value of the golden hello for new mathematics teachers from &amp;#x00A3;4,000 to &amp;#x00A3;5,000 for trainees entering PGCE courses from September 2005 onwards;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;subject to the statutory advice of the School Teachers' Review Body, removing the cap on pay for mathematics ASTs, currently just under &amp;#x00A3;50,000, guaranteeing them a minimum salary of &amp;#x00A3;40,000;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;doubling the number of undergraduates on the student associates scheme from 5,000 this year to 10,000 places by 2005&amp;#x2013;06, a high proportion of which will be in the shortage subjects. This programme&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS2&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;encourages good quality undergraduates to consider training as teachers by giving them experience of working in schools as volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My proposals to support teachers' continuing professional development include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;setting out priorities for the new National Centre for Excellence in Mathematics Teaching which will provide strategic direction and leadership and, in partnership with the Advisory Committee for Mathematics Education, draw together the wider mathematics community to contribute their expertise and leadership. We expect to invite tenders by March 2005;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;discussing with the profession the use of one inset day for subject-specific professional development from 2007;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;developing pools of mathematics expertise within schools to increase the relevance and range of CPD opportunities on offer at a local level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My proposals for the curriculum, assessment and qualifications include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;deciding on the introduction of a two-tier mathematics GCSE this autumn once evaluation of the pilot is complete following this summer's exams. This could be taught nationwide from September 2006;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;asking the QCA to develop guidance for an extension curriculum separately at key stage 3 and 4 to stretch more able learners;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;looking to the working group on 14&amp;#x2013;19 reform to draw on the recommendations for curriculum pathways in the Smith report. Their final report is due in the autumn;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;looking to the QCA to work closely with the wider mathematics community as well as ACME on taking forward these and other proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that together these proposals will provide an effective answer to the challenges ahead and that they represent a fair balance between the needs of mathematics as a subject, what is reasonable in the context of other subjects and what is affordable. Needless to say, taking these proposals forward successfully will depend to a large extent on the advice and continuing support of the mathematics community and I will be looking to them for this.&lt;/p&gt;" title='Mathematics Teaching' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/jun/28/mathematics-teaching'></outline>

      <outline id='2537082' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Whitty):&lt;p&gt; My right honourable friend the Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality has made the following Written Ministerial Statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I am pleased to announce my decision on the proposal for a New Forest National Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have carefully considered the inspector&apos;s report on the public inquiry into the New Forest National Park (Designation) Order 2002 made by the Countryside&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0663P0I0974"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS3&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;Agency under the provisions of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. In line with the inspector&apos;s recommendations, I have decided that the area now proposed for designation meets the criteria and purposes of a national park and should be managed by a national park authority to be established under the provisions of the Environment Act 1995. I have decided to confirm the designation order, with modifications, so creating a New Forest National Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I accept the boundary recommended by the inspector with some modifications. The inspector has recommended the exclusion of some areas that are within the boundary proposed in the Countryside Agency&apos;s designation order, and the addition of three small areas which were not included. I am minded to agree the three additions, expanding one of them to take in a further area of land outside the designation order boundary. In addition, I have decided to retain two areas within the park that the inspector recommended should be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the provisions of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 details of the proposed additions to the designation order boundary will be made available to the public for a minimum of 28 days to enable any objections and representations to be made. Details of where and when details of the proposed additions can be viewed, and the time limits for the receipt of objections and representations, will be advertised shortly in the national and local press. I will consider all duly made objections and representations and if necessary call a public inquiry or a hearing to consider them. When the boundary is finalised, I will announce the confirmation of the designation order with its final modifications as well as the date for the creation of the New Forest National Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I confirm the designation order, I propose also to commit to confirming the order made by the Countryside Agency to revoke the South Hampshire Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty to coincide with the park coming into being. The New Forest National Park as now proposed would cover over 95 per cent of the land currently designated as the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and it would be inappropriate to have concurrent national landscape designations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the successful conclusion of the further steps required to confirm the designation order, I propose to bring forward a further order under the provisions of the Environment Act 1995 to create a national park authority. I expect the new authority to take on its full range of statutory powers and functions from 1 April 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS4&lt;/col&gt;' title='New Forest National Park' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/jun/28/new-forest-national-park'></outline>
