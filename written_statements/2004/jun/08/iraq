          <p class="first-para">On 4 May, I told the House that 33 cases of civilian deaths, injuries or alleged ill-treatment in Iraq have been investigated by Service Police. The Secretary of State repeated this figure in the House on 10 May, as did the Prime Minister on 12 May.</p><p>A detailed verification exercise was put in place to ensure that all cases were being properly investigated and centrally reported.

I will continue to update the House on significant developments as appropriate.</p>
