          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0662P0-07212">Elections were held on Thursday June 10 2004 for local authorities in England and Wales, for the London Assembly, for the Mayor of London and for the European Parliament. Following the passage of the <a href="/acts/european-parliamentary-and-local-elections-pilots-act-2004">European Parliamentary and Local Elections (Pilots) Act 2004</a>, voting in four regions of England&#x2014;the north-east, the north-west, Yorkshire and the Humber and the east Midlands&#x2014;was carried out by postal ballot. The elections were successfully completed. A total of 6,044 councillors were elected in England and Wales; 25 members of the London Assembly were elected; a Mayor of London was elected; and 78 United Kingdom members of the European Parliament were elected.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_47ws' title='Col. 47WS &mdash; HL Deb 21 June 2004 vol 662 c47WS' name='column_47ws' href='#column_47ws' rel='bookmark'>47WS</a><p id="S5LV0662P0-07213">In summary, the picture is as follows. In the four all-postal pilot regions, overall turnout in the European parliamentary election has more than doubled, compared to that in 1999, going up from about 20 per cent to 42 per cent. In the other regions, turnout is also up, but by around half on the 1999 figures. Nearly three million more people voted in the four pilot regions in these European elections than in 1999. In places with all-postal local elections last week, turnout was substantially higher than elsewhere, with cities such as Leeds, Sheffield and Liverpool showing increases in turnout of around half as much again since the last local elections. We believe therefore that the all-postal pilots have shown, on a significantly larger scale than ever before, that a system in which a postal vote is automatically given to every elector positively encourages participation.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07214">The Electoral Commission will evaluate the pilots, and its report is due to be published in mid-September. The commission will examine the extent to which the manner in which the elections were conducted affected the incidence of electoral offences or malpractice. During the elections, a number of allegations of malpractice were made. Allegations of malpractice and fraud will be investigated, but, with a small number of exceptions, such allegations are not reflected in either the experiences of the electoral administrators or reports to the Crown Prosecution Service. Regional returning officers are not reporting a higher volume of problems than in previous elections. For example, the regional returning officer for the north-west, Sir Howard Bernstein, and the Greater Manchester Police issued a joint statement saying:
          <q>While the nature of allegations has changed this year, the scale has not increased&#x2014;if anything, it has lessened".</q></p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07215">There were also some concerns expressed about the witness signature requirement on the declaration of identity form. The Government and the Electoral Commission had reservations about that requirement, and it was almost certainly a factor in limiting turnout. In pilots in local elections in 2003, there was a significantly higher turnout where no witness statement was used. We believe that there are better alternative security arrangements which avoid complexity and avoid the need for electors to disclose their intention to cast a ballot.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07216">There were, in addition, a number of technical difficulties during the pilots. Returning officers, the Royal Mail and other suppliers worked very effectively together to overcome those difficulties where they occurred. Of the 14.1 million ballot packs, over 99 per cent were issued by returning officers by the deadline of midnight on 1 June. The few remaining packs were issued by 5.10 the following morning. Royal Mail provided an outstanding service in supporting the administrators and suppliers and ensuring that their role in the process was delivered effectively.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07217">Our judgement is therefore that the pilots confirm conclusions from previous pilots in 2002 and 2003. These have already been evaluated by the Electoral Commission, which concluded that, with some further
          <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_48ws' title='Col. 48WS &mdash; HL Deb 21 June 2004 vol 662 c48WS' name='column_48ws' href='#column_48ws' rel='bookmark'>48WS</a>
          development, there should in future be a statutory presumption in favour of all-postal voting in local elections. The Government are therefore also confirming their intention for the proposed autumn regional referendums in the three northern regions to be on an all-postal basis.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07218">The success of the all-postal pilots will provide a strong base from which we can develop a multichannel approach to elections in the future, giving further choice and opportunity to electors to have their say. Lessons from the pilots will be incorporated into the Government's wider plans for electoral modernisation, which include traditional methods of voting and alternatives such as postal balloting and electronic voting.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07219">Although testing all-postal voting on this scale was bound to present challenges, the challenges were met, and the Government believe that this is a positive result for engagement and participation in the democratic process.
