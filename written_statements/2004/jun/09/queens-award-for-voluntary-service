          <p class="first-para">I am pleased to report that this year's winners of the Queen's Awards for Voluntary Service (previously known as the Queen's Golden Jubilee Award) were announced on Wednesday 2 June.</p><p>This prestigious annual Award for groups of volunteers has been given this year to 110 groups whose outstanding voluntary activity has enhanced and improved the quality of life and opportunity for others in the community. The Government actively supports the work of the voluntary and community sector and are encouraging more people to participate in community activity. This Award will give some of those people the recognition they richly deserve. The details of the winning groups are as follows:
