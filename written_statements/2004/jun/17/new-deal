          <p class="first-para">I have today published a paper "Building on New Deal: Local solutions meeting individual needs" winch provides details of our strategy for building on the success of our employment programmes. A copy has been placed in the Library and copies are available for hon. Members from the Vote Office. This follows the publication of our preliminary paper on the 19 May.</p><p>The UK employment rate is now the highest in the G7, and the unemployment rate the lowest. Employment has risen in every region of the UK, and risen more in areas that previously had the lowest employment rates. The number of unemployed people has fallen by over 600,000 on both measures since 1997 to its lowest level for over a quarter of a century.</p><p>This success reflects a comprehensive economic strategy that the Government has put into place since 1997. At the heart of this success has been our welfare to work policies such as the new deal programmes, which have helped well over a million people to find work.</p><p>We have achieved significant falls in unemployment and rises in the employment levels of lone parents and older workers. But we are determined to do even more for those who face the most difficult barriers to work. We will build upon the success of the new deal, strengthening its ability to help people who face particular difficulties in moving into employment. This requires a personalised approach where personal advisers and local managers are given sufficient flexibility to deliver solutions appropriate for individuals and local labour markets. This strategy builds on existing policies to secure social justice for those who too often have been left behind, and to enable them to realise their full potential, to the economic and social benefit of the whole community and to achieve the goal of full employment in every region and nation of the UK.</p><p>We will be working with the devolved administrations, our private and voluntary sector partners and other organisations to successfully deliver this new approach and help even more people to move from benefit dependency into work.</p>
