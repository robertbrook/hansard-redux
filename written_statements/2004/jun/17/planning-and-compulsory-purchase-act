          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0662P0-07140">My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07141">The <a href="/acts/planning-and-compulsory-purchase-act">Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act</a> received Royal Assent on 13 May. The Government intend to bring the provisions of the Act into force over the coming months through a series of commencement orders. It is the convention that no part of an Act should be brought into effect earlier than two months after Royal Assent other than in exceptional circumstances.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07142">The Act contains a number of powers enabling the Secretary of State to make subordinate legislation such as regulations or orders. The first commencement order will bring the enabling powers to make subordinate legislation into effect, and it is intended that this order will be made in the second half of July. Subordinate legislation will then be made. Our general approach is to bring substantive provisions of the Act relating to England into force by further commencement orders, which will take effect at the same time as the relevant regulations or orders.</p><p id="S5LV0662P0-07143">The following timetable sets out an indicative timetable for these commencement orders.
