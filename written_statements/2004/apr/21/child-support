The ratio of cases reaching calculation compared to those that closed continued to be 6:4 to the year's end, comparing favourably with the ratio of 4:6 under the old scheme.</p><p>Technical issues continue to preclude reliable figures on compliance and throughput for the latest quarter. The Department continues to retain around 15&#x2013;20 per cent. of each monthly payment due to EDS, the service provider, due to the continuing problems with the computer and telephony systems.
