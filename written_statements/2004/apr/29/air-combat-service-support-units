          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0660P0-05492">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Defence (Mr Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05493">The Ministry of Defence is continually examining ways of improving military capability and value for money for the taxpayer, including by keeping the size and location of our bases under review.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05494">On 14 August 2003, I announced a review of the future basing requirement for the RAF's air combat service support units (ACSSUs), elements of the air surveillance and control system (ASACS) and some other minor units and the potential impact on the future requirement for RAF Boulmer, RAF Neatishead, RAF Sealand and RAF Stafford, should relocation of units currently based there be recommended.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05495">The primary objective of this particular review was to meet the department's basing needs in the light of the move towards expeditionary operations. A number of options were identified on which my officials have consulted widely. A number of honourable Members have made representations. The review has now concluded.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05496">I am now able to inform the House that I am inclined, subject to formal consultation with the trade unions, to accept the option which creates an ACSSU communications hub and a base for ASACS units at RAF Scampton and an ACSSU logistics hub at RAF Wittering. Implementation of this option as a whole would be over an extended period, beginning later this year and not complete until about 2012.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05497">This option offers the greatest operational flexibility to our Armed Forces by collocating support units on

          main operating bases. It is also the most cost-effective solution. It would mean that communications personnel would relocate to Scampton from RAF Sealand (from 2005) and RAF Brize Norton (from 2005), together with ASACS units currently based at RAF Neatishead (from 2004&#x2013;05) and RAF Boulmer (from 2009), bringing the total number of people at the station up to around 2,400 by 2012. In the case of RAF Wittering, logistics personnel would relocate from RAF Stafford (from 2005). This would increase the number of personnel at the station to around 2,130 by 2006.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05498">The Ministry of Defence has written to the trade unions to ask for their formal response to this option by 7 June 2004.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05499">I will make my decision when I have received trade unions' comments and will inform the House at that time.</p>
