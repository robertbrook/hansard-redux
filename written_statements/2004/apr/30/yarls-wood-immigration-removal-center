          <p class="first-para">The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration The Government have today published the report of Stephen Shaw, the prisons and probation ombudsman, into the allegations of racism and abuse at Yarl's Wood immigration removal center, which were reported by the Daily Mirror in December. The report is available on the immigration and nationality directorate (IND) website at<span class="underline">http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/default.asp?pageid = 4903.</span> Copies of the report have been placed in the House Library.</p><p>We are very grateful to Stephen Shaw for the speed and thoroughness of his investigation and for the comprehensive nature of his report.</p><p>The investigation of this matter has revealed a number of disconcerting incidents at Yarl's Wood and confirmed that the principal allegations published by the Daily Mirror were correct. However, Stephen Shaw was able to establish that the remarks reported by the Daily Mirror were made by a small number of people at Yarl's

          Wood and that there was no evidence to indicate a general culture of racism or the improper use of force at the center.</p><p>Stephen Shaw's investigation was preceded by an internal investigation by Global Solutions Ltd. (GSL), the company contracted by IND to operate Yarl's Wood. This investigation resulted in the dismissal of one member of staff and the suspension of another, followed by his resignation. Stephen Shaw satisfied himself as to the thoroughness of the GSL investigation and the appropriateness of the action taken by the company thereafter.</p><p>Stephen Shaw's report, which also covers the security implications of the journalist's undercover activity, contains 19 recommendations directed at GSL and ten recommendations directed at IND and the independent monitoring board (IMB) at Yarl's Wood. GSL have responded positively to the recommendations made to them. We have accepted all the recommendations, including that relating to the need to investigate an historical allegation of assault on a detainee, and IND officials will be working closely with GSL and the IMB to implement them.</p>
