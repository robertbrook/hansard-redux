      <outline id='3540496' text='The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Elliot Morley)&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00795"&gt;Charges to cover the costs of local enforcing authorities in regulating processes which are subject to Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (Local Air Pollution Control (LAPC)) were introduced in April 1991. Interim charges for installations which are subject to the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999 (Local Air Pollution Prevention and Control (LAPPC) and Local Authority&amp;#x2014;Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (LA-IPPC)) were introduced in August 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00796"&gt;With the approval of the Treasury to the extent required, and following consultation with local authority associations and industry, myself with my right hon. Friend, the Minister for Sustainable Food and Farming have made revised schemes in respect of the Environmental Protection Act England and Wales and in respect of the Pollution Prevention and Control Act. The schemes specify the scale of fees and charges to take effect from 1 April 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00797"&gt;There will be a 2.75 per cent. increase to the LAPC, LAPPC and the LA-IPPC fees and charges schemes for 2004&amp;#x2013;05. One of the factors taken into account was the take-up of cost accounting by local authorities which, when fully adopted, should provide the evidence of the adequacy or otherwise of current charging levels. According to my Department&apos;s statistics, 66 per cent. of local authorities had adopted cost accounting practices for LAPC by 31 March 2003, compared with 51 per cent. by the same date in 2002. A further 19 per cent. had said they intended to introduce cost accounting by the end of 2003&amp;#x2013;-04, while the remaining 15 per cent. have no stated plans to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00798"&gt;There will also be an additional fee spread over the 18,000 regulated activities, amounting to approximately &amp;#x00A3;&amp;#x2154; per standard activity. This is required to cover the &amp;#x00A3;40,000 necessary to recover the costs of the Environment Agency&apos;s technical unit which provides guidance notes for use by local authorities and operators and is funded under the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00799"&gt;The schemes will be laid before both Houses and copies placed in the Libraries.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Local Authority Fees 2004â€“05' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/apr/01/local-authority-fees-2004-05'></outline>
      <outline id='3540498' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Mr. Ben Bradshaw)&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00800"&gt;In June 2003, the Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) published its report and recommendations on the welfare of farmed animals at&lt;image src="S6CV0419P2I0058"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;101WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;slaughter. It was a valuable and comprehensive report and I am grateful to the council for the work they put into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00801"&gt;The report contains 94 recommendations for improvements in the welfare of animals at the time of slaughter or killing and the Government are prepared to accept, or partially accept, the majority of them. But the Government also accept that FAWC&apos;s recommendation to ban the slaughter of animals without prior stunning on welfare grounds has been contentious for the Jewish and Muslim communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00802"&gt;The Government also recognise that such a ban would be likely to result in kosher and halal meat being imported with no overall improvement in animal welfare. We also think that there is a strong possibility that a legal challenge to a ban on slaughter without prior stunning would succeed on the grounds that the practice is protected under the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00803"&gt;While the Government therefore propose to reject the FAWC recommendation to ban slaughter without prior stunning, we recommend that cattle slaughtered by having their throats cut should receive an immediate post-cut stun because of the time it takes cattle to lose consciousness This should be progressed on a voluntary basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00804"&gt;In addition to the issues identified by FAWC, the consultation provides an ideal opportunity for a debate on whether meat from animals slaughtered without prior stunning for the kosher and halal markets should be labelled voluntarily. Some meat that has been slaughtered without the animal previously being stunned finds its way onto the ordinary meat market. At present, such meat is not required to be labelled to indicate the method of slaughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00805"&gt;We are today issuing our response to the FAWC report for consultation on all aspects including those identified in this statement.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Farm Animal Welfare Report' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/apr/01/farm-animal-welfare-report'></outline>

In addition, the regulations will further protect public health by ensuring that the results of clinical trials are collected, recorded and analysed in accordance with internationally recognised principles so that they can be audited and verified before being used to impact on public health, for example through a publication that changes medical prescribing practice or as evidence to support applications to place medicines on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00821"&gt;The Regulations will provide a statutory basis for:&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;standardisation of procedures for ethical and competent authority consideration and authorisation;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;good clinical practice (GCP) standards for commencing and conducting clinical trials;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards for medicines used in clinical trials; and&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;inspections against internationally accepted principles and standards of GCP and GMP, supported by enforcement powers.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00822"&gt;The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Department of Health will be publishing guidance on the new procedures which the regulations will implement from 1 May 2004. This will cover applications for clinical trial authorisations, inspections, ethics committee applications, informed consent for incapacitated adults and sponsorship of clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00823"&gt;The Government have undertaken extensive consultation with stakeholders in both the pharmaceutical industry and the non-commercial clinical trials sector on how to implement the Directive. Where possible, concerns expressed by the non-commercial sector, in particular, about the possible regulatory burden have been taken into account in the UK Regulations. Furthermore, the MHRA and Department of Health have been working with stakeholders to help them comply with the practical requirements of the regulations. The Government believe that the regulations achieve a proper balance by safeguarding the rights of patients involved in clinical trials while avoiding a disproportionate impact on those who carry out clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Clinical Trials Directive' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/apr/01/clinical-trials-directive'></outline>

      <outline id='3540521' text='The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Mr. Andrew Smith)&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00824"&gt;The Department of Work and Pensions laid before the house on 18 November 2002 a consultation document entitled: "Pathways to Work&amp;#x2014;Helping People into Employment", (Cm 5690). This outlined a range of proposals to provide more effective support to people with health conditions and disabled people. The Pathways to Work are at the leading edge of international best practice on the help and support that is on offer for people whose job prospects are affected by a health condition or disability. In a recent economic survey by the OECD, Pathways to Work has been described as a "radically new approach to dealing with those on incapacity benefits".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00825"&gt;On 27 October, I announced the launch of the first three pilots&amp;#x2014;Bridgend and Rhondda Cynon Taf; Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, Argyll &amp;amp; Bute; and Derbyshire. I know there has been considerable interest in these groundbreaking reforms and I wish to update colleagues on progress in the first three pilots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00826"&gt;To date, the specially trained personal advisers we have put in place have carried out over 3,000 Work Focused Interviews with promising results. Many customers are, as we believed; keen to actively consider a return to work and positive about the help on offer. They are keen to participate in the NDDP Programmes and NHS Condition Management Programmes. By mid-March, well over 400 customers had been referred to NDDP Programmes and in the first few weeks of operation, around 130 people had been referred to Condition Management Programmes. The Return to Work Credit of &amp;#x00A3;40 a week is also proving a popular incentive, with approximately 700 awards made, helping incapacity benefits recipients make that final step back into work. Furthermore, there are over 700 longer-term recipients who have volunteered to work with an adviser to try and find a job. These figures are drawn from management reports and are provisional&amp;#x2014;validated statistics are expected to be available from May. With over 700 people helped back to work and off benefits, these pilots are already changing many people&apos;s lives. One such example is from Tonypandy, where a client who had been claiming Incapacity Benefit since 1978 due to a back problem and depression, with the support from her Personal Adviser, and help from Return to Work Credit, Adviser Discretion Fund, Tax Credits and New Deal 50+, started work as a Production Operator after 25 years on benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00827"&gt;On 5 June, I announced the locations of the final four pilots&amp;#x2014;East Lancashire, Essex, Gateshead &amp;amp; South Tyneside and Somerset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00828"&gt;My Department, together with the Department of Health have been preparing for the implementation of these pilots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00829"&gt;&lt;col&gt;106WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;In the Budget we also announced the expansion of the specialist Personal Adviser service to more actively support some longer-term IB recipients. We will also be introducing a new financial incentive to support customers as they undertake return to work activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00830"&gt;Today, I am pleased to announce that these pilots will be launched on 5 April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00831"&gt;The pilots are to run until 2006 and the impact of the extra support will be fully evaluated before decisions are made about extending the measures.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Pathways to Work' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/apr/01/pathways-to-work'></outline>

In this report Kofi Annan announced that his proposal for a comprehensive Cyprus settlement (the Annan Plan) remained on the table.

Encouraged by the attitude of the Turkish Cypriots and aware of the potential positive impact a Cyprus settlement would have on its own EU aspirations, the JVKP government in Ankara led by Prime Minister Erdogan signalled its own willingness to tje-engage and work constructively for a settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00849"&gt;The parties (the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Greece and Turkey) were therefore invited to New York by the Secretary-General on 4 February 2004 in order to resume negotiations towards a settlement on the basis of the Annan Plan. On 13 February, following an initial round of discussions, the Secretary-General announced that the parties had agreed to resume talks on the basis of the Annan Plan and had committed themselves to a three phase process leading to a finalised plan being submitted to simultaneous, separate referendums on 24 April&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00850"&gt;The 13 February agreement was a landmark achievement. The parties had committed themselves to a strict timetable and a negotiation process which led inexorably towards simultaneous referendums on a pre-determined date on the basis of a settlement plan which, absent agreement between the parties (including, in the final stage, Greece and Turkey) would be finalised by the Secretary-General himself. Negotiations between the two sides resumed in Cyprus on 19 February. In parallel to the main political level negotiations between the leaders of the two communities, technical committees started to work through the whole range of laws and administrative texts and practical arrangements necessary to give effect to the new state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00851"&gt;During this phase of the negotiations, our High Commissioner in Nicosia informed the UN that the UK&apos;s earlier offer to the UN of giving up roughly half of the territory of the Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus remained valid, subject to some small changes in the map. The land to be ceded to the United Cyprus Republic would not in any way compromise the operational capabilities of the bases themselves.

The UK attended in its capacity as a Guarantor Power in order to assist the efforts of the UN Secretary-General&apos;s Good Offices Mission. The European Commissioner for Enlargement, Gunter Verheugen, also attended for the final days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00853"&gt;On 29 March the Secretary-General presented the parties with a revised plan. This revision was produced following extensive consultation and aimed to strike a balanced compromise, building on the earlier version of the Annan Plan which had been presented to the parties in February 2003, and taking subsequent developments and both sides&apos; views carefully into account. Following a further final round of meetings between the Secretary-General, the parties and Greece and Turkey, Kofi Annan called the parties together late on 31 March. Announcing that the time for negotiation and&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;110WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;consultation was over, and that the time for decision and action had arrived, the Secretary-General presented the parties and the Guarantor Powers (Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom) with his finalised plan&amp;#x2014;Annan IV&amp;#x2014;for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00854"&gt;In his remarks, Kofi Annan said that the Plan was inevitably a compromise. It did not satisfy everyone&apos;s demands. But he believed that it met the core interests, and addressed the key concerns, of people on both sides. He added that the choice was not between the Plan and some other mythical solution. In reality, the choice was between the settlement on offer or no settlement at all. The Government shares this view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00855"&gt;No one is under any illusion about what remains to be done. No one is saying that reunification will be easy. But the plan is balanced and fair, and offers all Cypriots the chance of a better future as citizens of a United Cyprus Republic within the European Union. The Government believes strongly that this is a chance that must not be squandered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S6CV0419P2-00856"&gt;The final decision will now be taken by the Cypriots themselves in separate, simultaneous referendums to be held on 24 April.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Cyprus' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/apr/01/cyprus'></outline>

The European Commissioner for Enlargement, Gunter Verheugen, also attended for the final days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09689"&gt;On 29 March the Secretary-General presented the parties with a revised plan. This revision was produced following extensive consultation and aimed to strike a balanced compromise, building on the earlier version of the Annan plan which had been presented to the parties in February 2003, and taking subsequent developments and both sides&apos; views carefully into account. Following a further final round of meetings between the Secretary-General, the parties and Greece and Turkey, Kofi Annan called the parties together late on 31 March. Announcing that the time for negotiation and consultation was over, and that the time for decision and action had arrived, the Secretary-General presented the parties and the guarantor powers (Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom) with his finalised plan&amp;#x2014;Annan IV&amp;#x2014;for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S5LV0659P0I1259"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 69&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09690"&gt;In his remarks, Kofi Annan said that the plan was inevitably a compromise. It did not satisfy everyone&apos;s demands. But he believed that it met the core interests, and addressed the key concerns, of people on both sides. He added that the choice was not between the plan and some other mythical solution. In reality, the choice was between the settlement on offer or no settlement at all. The Government share this view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09691"&gt;No one is under any illusion about what remains to be done. No one is saying that reunification will be easy. But the plan is balanced and fair, and offers all Cypriots the chance of a better future as citizens of a United Cyprus Republic within the European Union. The Government believe strongly that this is a chance which must not be squandered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09692"&gt;The final decision will now be taken by the Cypriots themselves in separate, simultaneous referendums to be held on 24 April.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Cyprus' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/apr/01/cyprus'></outline>

We have maintained a continuous presence in Kabul where our troops have once again established a high reputation. That useful work has been complemented by our provincial reconstruction team (PRT) in Mazar-e-Sharif, currently operating under the command of the coalition across the five provinces of Balkh, Faryab, Jowzjan, Samangan and Sar-e-Pol. No one should doubt the United Kingdom&apos;s commitment to Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09702"&gt;United Nations Security Council Resolution 1510 authorised ISAF to expand beyond Kabul and offered the opportunity to start to bring the ISM&apos; and the PRTs together. Since December 2003, NATO has operated its own PRT in the north-eastern city of Konduz as part of ISAF. Building on that experience, and that of coalition PRTs, NATO&apos;s detailed operational planning to expand the ISAF across Afghanistan is nearing completion. In view of the parliamentary Recess I believe the House would wish to be informed of developments which are likely to occur shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09703"&gt;Within this planning, and in conjunction with our international partners, we have offered to NATO to lead the expansion process in the north of the country, where we already have a significant presence through our own PRT. As part of our expanded commitment, and once NATO has agreed its operational plan, we shall lead a second multinational PRT that we intend to establish in the northern city of Meymaneh. Again, in co-operation with our international partners, we shall establish and maintain facilities to support PRTs across the north of Afghanistan. Finally, we plan to transfer command of the PRT in Mazar-e-Sharif from the coalition to the ISAF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09704"&gt;This will require some increase in the number of British troops routinely deployed in Afghanistan, although until negotiations with our international partners are complete, I am not in a position to indicate what the precise total will be but I will keep the House informed as this develops. I can confirm, however, that this commitment, which will utilise forces allocated to but not deployed forward in Afghanistan and some other enabling elements in the initial stages, is sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S5LV0659P0I1260"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 71&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09705"&gt;The expansion of the ISAF will be a major challenge. The United Kingdom, in line with our determination to help the Afghan people to rebuild their country, is resolved to play its full part in meeting that challenge. By leading expansion in the north we shall do so in a sustainable and effective manner to the long-term benefit of Afghanistan and her people.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Afghanistan: Expansion of ISAF' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/apr/01/afghanistan-expansion-of-isaf'></outline>

The regulations will come into force on 1 May 2004, the date by which member states are required to implement the directive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09707"&gt;These regulations will ensure that the rights, safety and well-being of clinical trial subjects are protected by requiring sponsors of trials to be responsible for designing, conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials according to principles of good clinical practice derived from the principles set out in the amended 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, the regulations will further protect public health by ensuring that the results of clinical trials are collected, recorded and analysed in accordance with internationally recognised principles so that they can be audited and verified before being used to impact on public health, for example through a publication that changes medical prescribing practice or as evidence to support applications to place medicines on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09708"&gt;The regulations will provide a statutory basis for:&#x000A;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;standardisation of procedures for ethical and competent authority consideration and authorisation;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;good clinical practice (GCP) standards for commencing and conducting clinical trials;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards for medicines used in clinical trials; and&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;inspections against internationally accepted principles and standards of GCP and GMP, supported by enforcement powers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0659P0-09709"&gt;The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Department of Health will be publishing guidance on the new procedures which the regulations will implement from 1 May 2004.

Furthermore, the MHRA and Department of Health have been working with stakeholders to help them to comply with the practical requirements of the regulations.
