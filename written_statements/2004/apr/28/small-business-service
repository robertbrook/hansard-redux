          <p class="first-para">The Small Business Service (SBS) is today publishing its business plan for 2004&#x2013;05. I have deposited copies of the plan in the House of Commons Library.

The action plan defines Government's programme of work going forward and is the foundation for the 2004&#x2013;05 SBS business plan. The SBS has a leadership role as a center of expertise, an innovator and an engine for change within government based on its experience of delivering services to small businesses and its extensive research base and network of contacts.</p><p>The business plan sets out what the SBS will do to drive forward implementation of the Government action plan over the next 12 months. It also sets out the changes being made within the SBS to make a reality of its leadership role within Government on small business issues.</p><p>The plan identifies eight key agency targets for 2004&#x2013;05 grouped&#x2014;where relevant&#x2014;under the strategy to which they relate.</p><p><span class="italic">Building an enterprise culture</span>
