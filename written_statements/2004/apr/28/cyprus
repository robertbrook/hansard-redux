          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0660P0-05419">I would like to inform the House of developments in relation to Cyprus since my Written Statement of 1 April. In that Statement I described how, after talks in Cyprus and in Switzerland between the parties, and with the leaders of Greece and Turkey, the UN Secretary-General produced a final version of his comprehensive settlement proposals. I looked forward to the referendums scheduled for 24 April.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05420">The House will know that the referendum in the Turkish Cypriot community was carried by a large majority; but that in the Greek Cypriot community the settlement proposals were opposed by a large majority. Accordingly the Annan plan, which was designed to be self-executing in time for a reunited island to enter the EU on 1 May, is null and void. (The United Kingdom's offer of territory from the Sovereign Base Areas, which was an integral part of the plan, is also null and void.)</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05421">It follows that, on 1 May, Cyprus will join the EU, but in the absence of a settlement the EU <span class="italic">acquis</span> will be suspended in the north of the island.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05422">On the evening of 24 April, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary made the following statement. which I should like to draw to the attention of the House:
          <q>For thirty years, the international community has supported the efforts of Cypriots on both sides to resolve their differences and put an end to the tragic division of the island.</q>
          <q>Over the last few years, Kofi Annan and his team have built on earlier efforts and worked tirelessly to bring about a comprehensive settlement package which meets the key interests of the two sides, and provides a solid foundation for a durable bicommunal, bizonal federal solution.</q>
          <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_28ws' title='Col. 28WS &mdash; HL Deb 28 April 2004 vol 660 c28WS' name='column_28ws' href='#column_28ws' rel='bookmark'>28WS</a>
          <q>Britain has always given its strong support to the efforts of the UN and of those on both sides who have shown the courage to seek a realistic compromise solution.</q>
          <q>We will respect the choice which the Greek Cypriots have expressed today. But I hope that they will continue to reflect on whether this choice is the right one for them. By this decision a majority of Greek Cypriot voters has rejected the settlement, despite the prospect it offered of reuniting the island, providing long-sought relief for the refugees of 1974, and progressively lifting the weight of militarization&#x2014;all this within the framework of political stability and economic security which European Union membership provides.</q>
          <q>I am glad that the Turkish Cypriot community has voted so clearly for the settlement. The result shows what a fundamental change of attitude has taken place within the Turkish Cypriot community in recent years.</q>
          <q>I understand very well their wish to end their isolation in the world, to join with Greek Cypriots in a reunified island, and to move together into the European Union which is the best guarantee for the future of their collective security and prosperity. I want them to know that this remains our goal too, and that we will continue to work for its ultimate realisation.</q>
          <q>Meanwhile, I would like to assure all Cypriots that, if at any point in the future both communities decide in favour of a comprehensive settlement which would reunify the island in the European Union, the United Kingdom, as a guarantor power, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and a leading EU member state, not to mention a long-standing friend and supporter of Cyprus, will be exerting all its efforts to ensure that the settlement is the practical and political success which Cypriots have for so long deserved".</q></p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05423">These were the policies which he advocated at the 26 April meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg. They met with wide agreement from our European partners. There was regret that the Union's strong preference for accession by a reunited Cyprus had not proved possible. But there was also determination to build upon the positive aspects of the situation, including the contribution of the governments of Greece and Turkey, and in particular the pro-EU, pro-settlement vote of the Turkish Cypriot conummity. The conclusions in respect of Cyprus issued by the Council on Monday were as follows:
          <q>The Council noted the results of the referenda in Cyprus on 24 April and expressed its strong regret that the accession to the EU of a united Cyprus will not now be possible on 1 May. The Council expressed its deep appreciation for the determined and sustained efforts of the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his colleagues in the search for a comprehensive solution of the Cyprus problem. The Council also welcomed the contribution made by Greece and Turkey. It expressed its determination to ensure that the people of Cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united Cyprus in the European Union.</q>
          <q>The Turkish Cypriot community have expressed their clear desire for a future within the European Union. The Council is determined to put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community. The Council invited the Commission to bring forward comprehensive proposals to this end, with particular emphasis on the economic integration of the island and on improving contact between the two communities and with the EU. The Council recommended that the 259 million euros already earmarked for the northern part of Cyprus in the event of a settlement now be used for this purpose.</q>
          <q>The Council asked COREPER to expedite discussion of the regulation on a regime under Article 2 of Protocol 10 of the Act of Accession with a view to its adoption before 1 May, taking due account of the Council's desire to send a signal of encouragement to the Turkish Cypriot community that its future rests in a united Cyprus within the European Union".</q></p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_29ws' title='Col. 29WS &mdash; HL Deb 28 April 2004 vol 660 c29WS' name='column_29ws' href='#column_29ws' rel='bookmark'>29WS</a><p id="S5LV0660P0-05424">By these and other means we intend to demonstrate Europe's concern for the wellbeing of Turkish Cypriots. In the same spirit, we have noted the announced intention of the Cyprus Government to support the economic strengthening of the Turkish Cypriot community and to facilitate trade.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05425">As these conclusions indicate, neither the UK nor the EU as a whole is proposing any change in our longstanding and consistent policy of non-recognition of "TRNC".</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05426">We look forward to a report from the Secretary-General during the course of May about the future of his good offices mission.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05427">We continue to believe that the Annan plan represented the best available blueprint for a settlement. We share the UN Secretary-General's hope, expressed after the "no" vote on 24 April, that the Greek Cypriot electorate may arrive at a different view in the fullness of time, after a profound and sober assessment of their decision.</p>
