          <cite class='member author entry-title'><a href="/people/mr-david-sainsbury" title="Mr David Sainsbury">The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Sainsbury of Turville)</a></cite>
          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0660P0-05552">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05553">The Department of Trade and Industry has transformed its services to businesses by listening to the needs and priorities of business people.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05554">I am today launching a one-stop website for business. <span class="underline">Businesslink.gov.uk</span> will act as a gateway for information and support from across government.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05555">The new DTI-sponsored site removes the confusing array of advice about government services that up to now has confronted businesses&#x2014;particularly small businesses. Businesslink.gov is the result of a successful collaboration involving a wide range of government departments and agencies: the DTI, HM Treasury, the Office of the e-Envoy, the Small Business Service, the Inland Revenue, HM Customs and Excise, the Health and Safety Executive, the Department for Education and Skills, the Environment Agency, ACAS and Companies House.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05556">For the first time ever one site provides quick and easy online access for firms needing information about funding and services provided by departments and agencies, including advice on starting up a business, taxation, employing people and health and safety.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05557">Services include opportunities for businesses to register for e-filing with Customs and Excise, the Inland Revenue and Companies House in one go as

          well as a filter to help users to identify which licences they need to trade.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05558">Advice is provided in clear language on issues which businesses have identified as important and relevant to their needs. It is supported by practical tools to achieve results and therefore reduce the time that businesses have to spend on regulations and other matters.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05559">Work has now largely been completed on the radical restructuring of the DTI's business support to create products that promote enterprise innovation and best practice to meet customer need for a streamlined range of products that are easy to access.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05560">Four of these new products were released in 2003: grant for research and development, knowledge transfer partnerships, grant for investigating an innovative idea and the small firms loan guarantee.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05561">Five new support products became available to businesses during April this year. These are: collaborative research and development, knowledge transfer networks, access to best business practice, support to implement best business practice and selective finance for investment in England.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05562">Small and medium-sized businesses will be able to access these products through Business Link. Larger corporates and business organisations can access them through the DTI while the regional development agencies will deliver products which deal with specific regional issues. Detailed information about all these products is available to businesses through the business support directory available on Businesslink.gov.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05563">In the development of these products I have been advised by an expert investment committee that includes and is chaired by independent business members. The committee will ensure that the impact of DTI products is thoroughly evaluated and that there is a clear economic rationale for the support we provide.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05564">The closure of business support schemes that the DTI has funded in the past is progressing as quickly as possible but at a pace which meets outstanding commitments.</p>
