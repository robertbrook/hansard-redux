          <p class="first-para">I am pleased to announce today the significant achievement against the Government's bed-and-breakfast reduction target that, by March 2004, local authorities should ensure that no homeless family with children should have to live in a bed-and-breakfast hotel except in an emergency, and even then for no longer than six weeks.</p><p>

Local authorities reported a total of only 26 families with children in bed-and-breakfast in excess of six weeks as of 31 March compared with an estimated 3,500&#x2013;4,000 homeless families with children placed long-term in bed-and-breakfast hotels in March 2002. This reduction reflects the excellent achievement of local authorities working with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. A total of 328, or 95 per cent., of local authorities met the bed-and-breakfast target.</p><p>In London, where the highest concentrations of homelessness exist and where the highest number of families had been accommodated in bed-and-breakfast hotels, there were no homeless families who have been in bed-and-breakfast for longer than six weeks on 31 March.</p><p>Figures collected also show that the total number of homeless families with children in bed-and-breakfast was reduced by 88 per cent. from an estimated 6,730 in March 2002 to 780 in March 2004. This is the first sustained reduction in total use of bed-and-breakfast to house homeless families for over a decade.</p><p>Tabled below shows the breakdown of bed-and-breakfast figures for March 2004 for the 16 local authorities that failed to meet the target. A table showing the breakdown for all local authorities is available in the Libraries of both Houses. Further information is also available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's web site <span class="underline">www.odpm.gov.uk.</span></p><p>The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will continue to work with local authorities, voluntary sector organisations and other stakeholders to sustain this target and our successful reductions in rough sleeping. We will also continue to work with stakeholders on tackling and preventing wider homelessness problems more effectively.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_71ws' title='Col. 71WS &mdash; HC Deb 04 May 2004 vol 420 c71WS' name='column_71ws' href='#column_71ws' rel='bookmark'>71WS</a><p>

A number of families are described as "housed pending review outcome". In these cases the families have submitted an appeal against the authority's decision on their homelessness application. In such instances the local authority can choose to continue to house the family under discretionary powers.</p>
