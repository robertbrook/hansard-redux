          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0660P0-05535">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05536">I am pleased to announce today the significant achievement against the Government's bed and breakfast reduction target that, by March 2004, local authorities should ensure that no homeless family with children should have to live in a bed and breakfast hotel except in an emergency, and even then for no longer than six weeks.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05537">Figures collected by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister show a 99.3 per cent reduction in the number of homeless families with children living in bed and breakfast hotels for longer than six weeks, and who were placed there by a local housing authority as a discharge of a homelessness duty, over the two years since March 2002 when the target was set. Local authorities reported a total of only 26 families with children in B&B in excess of six weeks as of 31 March compared to an estimated 3,500 to 4,000 homeless families with children placed long-term in bed and breakfast hotels in March 2002. This reduction reflects the excellent achievement of local authorities working with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. A total of 328, or 95 per cent, of local authorities met the bed and breakfast target.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05538">In London, where the highest concentrations of homelessness exist and where the highest number of families had been accommodated in bed and breakfast hotels, there were no homeless families who had been in B&B for longer than six weeks on 31 March.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05539">Figures collected also show that the total number of homeless families with children in B&B was reduced by 88 per cent from an estimated 6,730 in March 2002

          to 780 in March 2004. This is the first sustained reduction in total use of bed and breakfast to house homeless families for over a decade.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05540">The table below shows the breakdown of bed and breakfast figures for March 2004 for the sixteen local authorities that failed to meet the target. A table showing the breakdown for all local authorities is available in the Libraries of the House. Further information is also</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05541"><table>
