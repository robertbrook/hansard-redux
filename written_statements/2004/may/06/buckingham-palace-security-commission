          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0660P0-05716">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has today published the Security Commission's report on the implications for security of the activities of the<span class="italic">Mirror</span> reporter, Ryan Parry, at Buckingham Palace. He announced, in another place on 19 November 2003 that he expected the review to cover all aspects of the process of checking those who form part of the Royal Household. He also said that one of the strengths of our democracy is that such breaches are open to scrutiny, that we can learn quickly from them, and nothing is swept under the carpet.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05717">We therefore welcome the Security Commission's report on this incident and applaud the thoroughness with which it has approached its task.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05718">The recommendations are clear and pragmatic and include the creation of a post of Director of Security for the Royal Households, the development of a wide range of checks that can be carried out on employees of the Royal Households and the creation of an annual plan to be agreed and implemented by the Households, together with the police and the Home Office.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_70ws' title='Col. 70WS &mdash; HL Deb 06 May 2004 vol 660 c70WS' name='column_70ws' href='#column_70ws' rel='bookmark'>70WS</a><p id="S5LV0660P0-05719">We are happy to note the progress that has already been made in the intervening period to improve security within the Royal Households and we look forward to the implementation of the report's recommendations. The appointment this week by Buckingham Palace of a Director of Security is particularly welcome, as this new post will oversee the security vetting process across the Royal Households reporting to the Queen's Private Secretary.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05720">It is clearly welcome to note the commission's finding that the existing framework for dealing with the security of the Royal Family is considered sound and provides an appropriate strategic structure for the oversight of security vetting and related work. Responsibility for delivery will accordingly continue to be shared: policy and funding responsibility to rest with the Home Secretary; operational responsibility to lie with the police; and the Royal Households having overall responsibility for personnel security and for procedures within royal residences. The commission recommended a tightening of the arrangements for day-to-day delivery of these procedures within the Royal Household through the creation of the Director of Security post, a new annual security plan and a regular process of review. Overall responsibility, as the House would expect, will continue to rest with the Home Secretary with the constituent parts of the system being responsible for delivery in their areas.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05721">The commission also met the authorities of the Palace of Westminster, in order to discover whether similar issues might arise in relation to Parliament. On reflection, the commission felt that the differences require a separate review, but none the less made a number of suggestions. The report will therefore be copied to those undertaking the existing security review of the Palace of Westminster announced by the Leader of the House of Commons last month. None the less, the commission endorsed recent changes to security at the Palace of Westminster, including the decision of the House of Commons Commission to construct a security screen around the public gallery on the recommendation of the Director General of the Security Service.</p>
