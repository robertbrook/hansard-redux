          <cite class='member author entry-title'><a href="/people/mr-david-sainsbury" title="Mr David Sainsbury">The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Sainsbury of Turville)</a></cite>
          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0661P0-08487">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Office has made the following Written Ministerial Statement today.</p><p id="S5LV0661P0-08488">The Government believe that current developments in science are providing significantly more opportunities to do work on the reduction of the number of animals used, the refinement of the procedures involved to minimise suffering, and the replacement of animal use (the 3Rs),
          <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_46ws' title='Col. 46WS &mdash; HL Deb 21 May 2004 vol 661 c46WS' name='column_46ws' href='#column_46ws' rel='bookmark'>46WS</a>
          and that to take advantage of these opportunities we should put more resources into this area and broaden the community of interest</p><p id="S5LV0661P0-08489">I am, therefore, pleased to inform the House that the Government are setting up a new national centre for research into the 3Rs and animal welfare. The Centre for Best Practice for Animals in Research (CBPAR), established by the Medical Research Council, will form the core of the new centre. The new centre will be called the National Centre for Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research, and will act as a focal point for research into the 3Rs.</p><p id="S5LV0661P0-08490">This decision implements the recommendation by the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures, in its report published in July 2002, that such a centre should be established, which we broadly accepted in the Government's reply in January 2003. The Government have today published a report prepared by the Inter-Departmental Group on the 3Rs (IDG3Rs) on the implementation of the Select Committee recommendation and have accepted its recommendation that responsibility for the new national centre should rest with the Office of Science and Technology, with its wider scientific remit, rather than with the Home Office, whose role is constrained by its regulatory function under the <a href="/acts/animals-scientific-procedures-act-1986">Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986</a>. A copy of the Inter-Departmental Group's report has been placed in the House Library.</p><p id="S5LV0661P0-08491">Placing the lead responsibility with the Office of Science and Technology emphasises that the 3Rs, humane experimental techniques, and the development of advanced research methods are part of the mainstream United Kingdom science base. It also acknowledges that department's leading role in signalling both the financial and scientific benefits of such developments. In the initial stages the centre will need the wider support and structure that the MRC can offer.</p><p id="S5LV0661P0-08492">A new board will be set up to direct the centre and I am delighted to announce that Lord Turnberg has agreed to chair this board, aided by Professor Paul Flecknell as vice-chair. The remaining membership of the board will be appointed shortly. It is envisaged that all major stakeholder groups will be represented, including academics, government, industry and animal welfare groups.</p><p id="S5LV0661P0-08493">The mission statement for the centre will be:
          <q>The National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research is dedicated to the 3Rs&#x2014;replacing, refining and reducing the use of animals in research and testing licensed under the <a href="/acts/animals-scientific-procedures-act-1986">Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986</a>.</q>
          <q>Replacement is the ultimate aim for the Centre, but for so long as the use of animals continues to be necessary, it is essential that every effort is made to minimise their use and improve welfare. Ensuring that laboratory welfare is optimised is critical for scientific, legal and ethical reasons.</q>
          <q>The Centre's mission is to advance and promote the 3Rs in research and testing using animals. This will be progressed by:</q>
          <q>Developing a UK strategy for the implementation of the 3Rs;</q>
          <q>Supporting high-quality research that advances the 3Rs;</q>
          
          <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_47ws' title='Col. 47WS &mdash; HL Deb 21 May 2004 vol 661 c47WS' name='column_47ws' href='#column_47ws' rel='bookmark'>47WS</a>
          <q>Promoting a co-ordinated approach to 3Rs research;</q>
          <q>Providing advice and guidance on the 3Rs and animal welfare to the scientific community;</q>
          <q>Supporting the UK scientific community's commitment to best practice in all aspects of laboratory animal science and welfare;</q>
          <q>Working with regulators on the acceptance of alternative methods for regulatory toxicology.</q></p><p id="S5LV0661P0-08494">The first task of the new board will be to develop the mission statement into a detailed action plan.</p><p id="S5LV0661P0-08495">The Centre will require more funding than currently being made available to CBPAR. The Medical Research Council and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council have both agreed to double the level of funding provided this year and the Home Office will transfer its budget for research into the 3Rs currently administered by the Animal Procedures Committee to the centre once current commitments have been honoured. It is envisaged that funding for the centre will increase further in future years and Lord Turnberg will be discussing this with government. He will also discuss funding commitments with other funders of research involving animals.</p>
