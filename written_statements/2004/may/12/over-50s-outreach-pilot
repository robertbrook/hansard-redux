          <p class="first-para">In December 2002, the Government published the Pensions Green Paper: "Simplicity, Security and Choice: Working and Saving for Retirement." Chapter 6: "Extending Opportunities for Older Workers" sets out a range of measures to increase employment among older workers, which is considered essential to address the pensions challenge.</p><p>The Over 50s Outreach pilot is one of these measures and supports PSA target 4c: In the three years to 2006, to increase the employment rate of people aged 50 and over, taking account of the economic cycle, and significantly reduce the difference between their employment rate and the overall rate.</p><p>Research has shown that contact from Jobcentre Plus can concern people aged over 50, particularly those on benefits such as incapacity benefit (IB), income support (IS), and severe disability allowance. Clients on these benefits may be concerned about Jobcentre Plus forcing them into work, or reducing their benefits, if queries about work are made, in spite of assurances from Jobcentre Plus to the contrary.</p><p>The pilot involves external organisations acting as an intermediary between the Jobcentre and the customer. These organisations will:
          <q>contact people aged 50 and over who are not in work, and encourage their use of Jobcentre Plus services or volunteering opportunities;</q>
          <q>market the back to work help, employment and volunteering opportunities available and overcoming the concerns of some IB and IS clients that their benefits may be affected if they approach a Jobcentre Plus office with a work related enquiry; and</q>
          <q>promote the back to work help available through Jobcentre Plus to people aged 50 and over who may not be aware of this help or who do not normally have contact with Jobcentre Plus.</q></p><p>The evaluation of these pilots will demonstrate what methods of contact and awareness raising worked most successfully to encourage people who would not otherwise have asked about or taken up Jobcentre Plus services and work or volunteering opportunities to do so. The methods that are most successful can then be disseminated throughout Jobcentre Plus to be incorporated into the continuous improvement of their services.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_19ws' title='Col. 19WS &mdash; HC Deb 12 May 2004 vol 421 c19WS' name='column_19ws' href='#column_19ws' rel='bookmark'>19WS</a><p>The pilot will run in seven Jobcentre Plus regions for two years and commenced in April 2004.
