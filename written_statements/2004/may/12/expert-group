        The group will be composed of external stakeholders similar to the expert external reference groups who helped create the national service framework for coronary heart disease with voluntary and professional organisations being invited to take part. Patients, cardiologists, GPs, nurses and members of voluntary and professional organisations (including CRY, the Ashley Jolly SAD Trust, Hearty Voices, the British Cardiac Society and the British Pacing and Electrophysiology Group) will be asked to join. Representatives from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will also be invited.

        We will be holding a stakeholders' event during the consultation period to raise awareness of the new group and invite wider consultation and participation. This will help to ensure that the key issues are covered and that the outcomes address the needs of all the interested parties.

        We propose four key workstreams for the expert group to manage its work, sudden cardiac death and screening; acute care; cardiac interventions; and patient involvement and support.

        It is estimated that 200&#x2013;400 young people die from sudden cardiac death syndrome each year. Dari Taylor MP's recent Private Members Bill highlighted a number of important issues that the new NSF chapter will need to address. These include:
        <q>Raising awareness of signs and symptoms of conditions that may lead to sudden cardiac death;</q>
        <q>Support for those who have lost relatives or friends;</q>
        <q>Considering the feasibility of guidelines on how these deaths are certified;</q>
        <q>Setting standards or practice recommendations around how suspected cases are treated in primary care;</q>
        <q>Promoting models of good practice for local use; and</q>
        <q>Design of an evidence-based protocol that clarifies when it is recommended that patients and/or their relatives should ideally be invited for screening.</q>

        For many patients the first sign of their cardiac condition is an emergency admission to hospital. Those who know they have the condition but whose care is not well managed may also need urgent treatment. Arrhythmia is consistently in the top 10 reasons for hospital admission, using up significant A&E time and bed days. This workstream will cover:
        <q>Design of a care pathway showing the ideal treatment of those who require emergency care for these conditions;</q>
        <q>Outlining what information patients require when in hospital to help them successfully manage their condition after discharge;</q>
        <q>Considering the feasibility of setting or practice recommendations around readmission rates for those with conditions which could be better managed; and</q>
        <q>Development of a set of audit indicators and suitable performance indicators that might be used locally around emergency care for those with arrhythmias and conditions which may lead to sudden cardiac death.</q>
      </p>

        Since publication of the NSF there have been significant improvements in both the technology and the clinical capacity to intervene to treat arrhythmias and related conditions, giving more options for this group of patients in terms of both diagnosis and treatment. New emerging technologies such as the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or more sophisticated pacing devices, with good medical evidence for their use, has given the cardiologist many more treatment options in 2004 compared to the 1990s. This workstream will cover:
        <q>Design of a care pathway for the diagnosis, management and treatment of arrhythmias and conditions which may lead to sudden cardiac death (considering cardiomyopathies, atrial fibrillation and electrical conduction disorders);</q>
        <q>Identification of models which deliver the appropriate interventions reliably; and</q>
        <q>Development of audit measures and suitable performance indicators around the care and treatment of people with these conditions, which might be used locally.</q>
      </p>

        Patients with a lifelong or long to term cardiac problem need continuing support to help them manage their condition and live as full a life as possible. Assistance also needs to be available for carers and family members
        <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_16ws' title='Col. 16WS &mdash; HC Deb 12 May 2004 vol 421 c16WS' name='column_16ws' href='#column_16ws' rel='bookmark'>16WS</a>
        where they wish it. Patients need to be involved in decisions about their own care and in helping to shape the planning of services. This workstream will include:
        <q>Design of care pathway for management and control of specific conditions (for example, atrial fibrillation);</q>
        <q>Development of guidance on monitoring patients with chronic conditions;</q>
        <q>Identifying effective ways of providing emotional support to patients and their relatives where appropriate; and</q>
        <q>Identifying effective means of involving patients in their own care and in influencing the way that services are provided.</q>

        The Department of Health would welcome contributions throughout the consultation. Emerging issues and contributions will be fed into the discussions of the expert group and used to develop the proposed new NSF chapter on arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.
