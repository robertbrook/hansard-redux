      <outline id='3551839' text='The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration (Mr. Desmond Browne)&lt;p&gt;This is a further report to the House on the Government&apos;s comprehensive review of legal migration schemes, including details on lifting the suspension of visa restrictions in Bulgaria and Romania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 30 March, my right hon Friend the Home Secretary announced that, as part of this wider review, Ken Sutton had been asked to investigate allegations of abuse of the European Community Association Agreements (ECAA) scheme by nationals from Bulgaria and Romania. At the same time, consideration of all visa and after-entry applications from these countries was suspended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 13 April, the suspension was lifted for the majority of visa applications in Bulgaria and Romania&amp;#x2014;for business and family visits, and low-risk categories such as official staff Visa applications remained suspended for the ECAA scheme, which relates to the self-employed, and for the employment schemes which were being investigated as part of the wider migration review. After entry applications remained suspended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;50WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time we were in contact with employers and operators who regularly employed Bulgarian and Romanian nationals under the temporary low-skill employment schemes. On 8 April we advised them that if they had pressing short-term labour needs, they should make alternative arrangements, since it could take several weeks before these schemes could be fully reviewed, and any necessary action taken, before they could be re-opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 22 April my right hon. Friend announced that a series of taskforces had identified a number of measures which would be implemented to reduce abuse of migration schemes, across all countries. The first set of measures concerned people posing as students, people pretending to provide education or training, and people marrying for immigration purposes. He indicated also that he had ordered a review (again across all countries) of the temporary low-skill employment schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following that review, I am today announcing changes to the quotas that apply to two temporary low-skill employment schemes, the seasonal agricultural workers scheme (SAWS) and the sectors based scheme (SBS). I am also announcing measures which will ensure that these schemes are not open to abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These schemes serve a valuable role in helping UK employers to recruit workers in sectors (agriculture, food processing and hospitality) where there are difficulties in meeting labour needs from the resident workforce. At the same time, it is important that these schemes should now reflect the fact that workers from the countries which joined the EEA on 1 May are now free to seek work in these sectors. Most important of all, it is important that these schemes are protected from abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am therefore announcing that the quota for 2005 for the seasonal agricultural workers scheme will be 16,250, a 35 per cent. reduction on the current quota; and from 1 June 2004, the existing overall quota for the sectors based scheme will be cut by 25 per cent. There will be a quota of 6,000 SBS permits for the food processing sector and 9,000 SBS permits for the hospitality sector. These quotas will be released in two half-yearly stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These reductions are based on the level of take-up of these schemes by Accession nationals, prior to accession on May 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am also announcing that the Home Office will introduce measures intending to ensure that those participating in our temporary employment schemes leave the United Kingdom at the end of their stay. These measures will include applying country-specific quotas within the overall quotas. These country-specific quotas will only be made available where we are confident that the source country will accept their nationals back if they are found to be here illegally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Home Office will consult industry on the detail of how these quotas will be applied, and will have immediate discussions in particular with the SAWS operators about action to ensure that the students who come in under this scheme return home at the end of their assignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I intend also to change the immigration rules so that those admitted under the SBS will no longer be able to switch into permanent migration schemes, such as work permit employment. Those admitted under SAWS are&#x000A;&lt;image src="S6CV0421P2I0033"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;51WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;currently not allowed to switch into permanent migration schemes, and new guidance will be issued to ensure that these rules are being enforced consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are also issuing new guidance to ensure that applicants for SBS and SAWS are subject to rigorous checks, and to ensure that we act swiftly on the basis of intelligence of abuse, including the use of fraudulent documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these additional controls in place on the temporary low-skill schemes, and in the light of our continuing review of abuse across all migration schemes, we are now in the position to take the next step in the progressive re-opening of visa applications from Bulgaria and Romania. With effect from today, I am announcing the lifting of the suspension on applications from Bulgaria and Romania for the temporary low-skill (SAWS and SBS) schemes, for the high-skill schemes (work permits and HSMP), and for all after-entry cases. The one exception is applications from the self-employed under the ECAA scheme, which will remain suspended in the light of the ongoing investigation by Ken Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further announcements will be made in due course relating to other aspects of the managed migration review.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Immigration Review' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/may/19/immigration-review'></outline>

      <outline id='3551842' text='The Minister for Housing and Planning (Keith Hill)&lt;p&gt;The Housing Bill introduces measures to help create a fairer and more effective housing market, and will protect those that are most vulnerable in that market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government have listened carefully during Commons consideration of the Bill and also to external stakeholders. It now plans to add two further measures to the Bill: provisions to tackle empty homes; and measures to protect tenancy deposits. These amendments will be tabled in due course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empty homes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are committed to finding ways of bringing empty homes back into use. We have already encouraged voluntary measures wherever possible, but recognise that more is needed to reduce significantly the number of privately owned homes that remain vacant for long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government therefore intend to enable local authorities to make management orders in respect of long-term empty homes. The legislation will contain the evidence a local authority would need to provide in support of an application to make a management order on an empty home. We will ensure intervention is proportionate, appropriately targeted and compliant with the Human Rights Act. Voluntary arrangements will continue to be appropriate in many circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empty homes management orders would support measures to increase housing supply. We will set out the precise scope of intervention in legislation. Our intention is to apply this measure to genuine cases of housing vacancy. We do not consider it would be appropriate to apply it to property that is genuinely&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;52WS&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;occupied, albeit not on a regular basis, or property subject to an action that will result in it coming back into use without the need for intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A management order would enable a local authority to put in place arrangements to enable a property to be let. In the case of a dilapidated property, this might entail renovation. The legal estate would be retained by the owner who would be entitled to any rental income generated by the loca1 authority after deduction of its relevant costs. The owner would be entitled to sell the property or request revocation of the management order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tenancy deposit protection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government also propose to add to the Housing Bill some provisions on tenancy deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government remain of the view that providing a link between the safeguarding of tenancy deposits and a requirement for all tenants to have written agreements is a sensible objective. However it accepts that the Law Commission proposals on tenure reform will take time to put into effect and need careful consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our intention is to add provisions to the Housing Bill to require that tenancy deposits should be subject to safeguarding arrangements. The Government accept that they will need to sponsor a scheme to provide for the safeguarding of the deposits sought by the majority of landlords. But they also recognise that members of trade or professional bodies should be able to look to those bodies to provide their own schemes if these schemes provide sufficient protection and the Government are able to approve them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The provisions will need to define the term "tenancy deposit" and provide that where such deposits are required by landlords or their agents they should be safeguarded by a scheme approved by the Government. There will need to be civil sanctions for non-compliance. There will need to be provisions for the timely return of deposits and for their repayment following dispute resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These measures&amp;#x2014;on empty homes and tenancy deposits&amp;#x2014;follow extensive consultation with the key stakeholders, and there will be an opportunity for further debate when they are tabled for inclusion in the Housing Bill.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Housing Bill' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/may/19/housing-bill'></outline>
      <outline id='3551843' text='The Minister for Local and Regional Government (Mr. Nick Raynsford)&lt;p&gt;Today, I am pleased to announce to the House the launch of a consultation on modernising electoral registration. This follows on from my written statement on the 15 January 2004,&lt;i&gt;Official Report,&lt;/i&gt; columns 42&amp;#x2013;43WS, when I announced the launch of the coordinated online register of electors (CORE) project. At that time I gave a commitment to consult with local government and others on the details for taking forward the project, including the proposed funding arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project will contribute to the modernisation of the electoral registration process in Great Britain by, first, standardising local electoral registers and, secondly, allowing authorised users to access local registration data centrally. It will support the achievement of our aim to hold a multi-channelled e-enabled general election sometime after 2006&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S6CV0421P2I0034"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;53WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders will have until 13 August 2004 to send in their responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copies of the consultation document are available in the Libraries of both Houses and will also be made available on the website of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Co-ordinated On-line Register of Electors' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/may/19/co-ordinated-on-line-register-of-electors'></outline>

      <outline id='3551846' text="The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Tessa Jowell)&lt;p&gt;The Government is continuing to work with the broadcasting industry and consumer representatives to facilitate the switch to digital television. Already over half of all households receive digital television services. In view of the progress to date switchover between 2006 and 2010 remains attainable. However it is apparent that more concerted action by broadcasters, retailers and manufacturers, supported by Government and Ofcom, is required if the full benefits of digital television are to be made available to the whole population within the desired period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Completing the switch to digital will bring significant benefits to consumers, to broadcasters and to the UK economy as a whole:&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;It will bring digital terrestrial television signals to the 25 per cent. of the population who live in areas that cannot currently receive them because of spectrum limitations;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Increased quality and choice for viewers;&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Broadcasters will no longer have to incur the costs of transmitting signals in both formats, releasing resources for investment in programming and other services for consumers; and&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;quote&gt;Spectrum will be released to allow the development of more television and other services for consumers.&lt;/quote&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC and the commercial public service broadcasters have a lead role in achieving switchover. They have an established relationship with virtually all Britain's households and are therefore uniquely placed to ensure a smooth transition to digital broadcasting. They will also benefit from reduced costs and from the ability to offer consumers a wider range of services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government have now written to the commercial terrestrial broadcasters and the BBC inviting them to engage with us and with Ofcom on how to achieve a complete switchover and to establish an appropriate timetable, in liaison with other stakeholders. The outcome of these discussions will be reflected in the digital licences which Ofcom will grant to ITV companies, Channel 4 and 5, and in the BBC's charter review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further stages in establishing the plan for switchover will be reported to the House in due course.&lt;/p&gt;" title='Digital Switchover' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/may/19/digital-switchover'></outline>

      <outline id='3551853' text='The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Mr. Andrew Smith)&lt;p&gt;I have today published a paper "Building on New Deal: Local Solutions Meeting Individuals&apos; Needs" which provides a summary of our strategy for building on the success of our employment programmes. A copy has been placed in the Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK employment rate is now the highest in the G7, and the unemployment rate the lowest. Employment has risen in every region of the UK5 and risen more in areas that previously had the lowest employment rates. The number of unemployed people has fallen by over 600,000 on both measures since 1997 to its lowest level for over a quarter of a century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This success reflects the comprehensive economic strategy that the Government have put into place since 1997. At the heart of this success have been our welfare to work policies, such as the new deal programmes, which have helped well over a million people to find work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have achieved significant falls in unemployment and rises in the employment levels of lone parents and older workers. But we are determined to do even more for those who face the most difficult barriers to work. We will build upon the success of the new deal, strengthening the new deal&apos;s ability to help people who face particular difficulties in moving into employment. This requires a personalised approach where personal advisers, local managers and service providers are given sufficient flexibility to deliver solutions appropriate for individuals and local labour markets. This strategy builds on existing policies to secure social justice for those who too often have been left behind, and to enable them to realise their full potential, to the economic and social benefit of the whole community and to achieve the goal of full employment in every region and nation of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are currently consulting on these proposals with a range of stakeholders, including the devolved administrations, Social Security Advisory Committee, the Disability Employment Advisory Committee, and the National Employment Panel. Once the views of stakeholders have been considered, a final paper setting out the full details of the proposals will be published.&lt;/p&gt;' title='"Building on New Deal: Local Solutions Meeting Individuals&apos; Needs"' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/may/19/building-on-new-deal-local-solutions'></outline>
      <outline id='3551856' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Mr. Chris Pond)&lt;p&gt;On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the benefit fraud inspectorate (BFI) follow-up inspection report on Kerrier district council was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S6CV0421P2I0035"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;55WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the housing Green Paper, "Quality and Choice: A Decent Home for All", published in April 2000, the Department for Work and Pensions developed a performance framework for housing benefits. The "performance standards for housing benefits" allow local authorities to make a comprehensive self-assessment of whether they deliver benefit effectively and securely. They are the standards that the Department for Work and Pensions expects local authorities to aspire to and achieve in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2002&amp;#x2013;03, Kerrier district council administered some &amp;#x00A3;23.1 million in housing benefits, about 60 percent. of its gross revenue expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BFI inspected Kerrier district council against the performance standards for housing benefits, and concludes that the council&apos;s benefits service had not reached standard in any of the seven functional areas&amp;#x2014;strategic management, customer services, processing of claims, working with landlords, internal security, counter-fraud and overpayments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first BFI inspection report, published in October 2001, BFI reported that claims processing was poor with a backlog of work, overpayment recovery was improving, and counter-fraud activity was working well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The follow-up report finds that the council&apos;s benefits service had made progress in improving its performance, implementing 68 per cent. of the recommendations from the earlier report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerrier district council had a clear vision, which was underpinned by policies, strategies and effective planning. Good progress had also been made in the area of overpayments, where sound practices were evident and recovery from benefit was strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verification of evidence supporting benefit claims was good in the majority of areas and management checking was clearly evidenced and used to good effect. However, speed of claims processing remained poor, compounded by the continuing backlog of work, with the council taking an average 88 days to process new benefit claims compared to the Performance Standard of 36 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The council&apos;s three-year best value plan set local targets for new claims, reported changes of circumstances and renewal claims processing. Although these were realistic targets for the council to achieve, they did not meet the performance standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The council&apos;s counter-fraud policy and positive drive towards quality fraud investigations had prompted a number of successful and publicised sanctions and prosecutions. This demonstrated that the council is serious about tackling benefit fraud. However, the report finds weaknesses, which included inadequate management control and poor communications between benefits and investigation staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive benefits overpayments policy and procedures manual was in place, high levels of management checks and controls were utilised, and most overpayment recovery methods were used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to further improve the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit, as well as counter-fraud activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;56WS&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p&gt;My right hon.

There will be a quota of 6,000 SBS permits for the food processing sector and 9,000 SBS permits for the hospitality sector. These quotas will be released in two half-yearly stages.&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08427"&gt;These reductions are based on the level of take-up of these schemes by accession nationals, prior to accession on 1 May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08428"&gt;We are also announcing that the Home Office will introduce measures intending to ensure that those participating in our temporary employment schemes leave the United Kingdom at the end of their stay. These measures will include applying country-specific quotas within the overall quotas. These country-specific quotas will be made available only where we are confident that the source country will accept their nationals back if they are found to be here illegally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08429"&gt;The Home Office will consult industry on the detail of how these quotas will be applied, and will have immediate discussions in particular with the SAWS operators about action to ensure that the students who come in under this scheme return home at the end of their assignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08430"&gt;We intend also to change the immigration rules so that those admitted under the SBS will no longer be able to switch into permanent migration schemes, such as work permit employment. Those admitted under SAWS are currently not allowed to switch into permanent migration schemes, and new guidance will be issued to ensure that these rules are being enforced consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08431"&gt;We are also issuing new guidance to ensure that applicants for SBS and SAWS are subject to rigorous checks, and to ensure that we act swiftly on the basis of intelligence of abuse, including the use of fraudulent documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08432"&gt;With these additional controls in place on the temporary low-skill schemes, and in the light of our continuing review of abuse across all migration&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0661P0I1050"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS33&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;schemes, we are now in the position to take the next step in the progressive reopening of visa applications from Bulgaria and Romania. With effect from today, we are announcing the lifting of the suspension on applications from Bulgaria and Romania for the temporary low-skill (SAWS and SBS) schemes, for the high-skill schemes (work permits and HSMP), and for all after-entry cases. The one exception is applications from the self-employed under the ECAA scheme, which will remain suspended in the light of the ongoing investigation by Ken Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08433"&gt;Further announcements will be made in due course relating to other aspects of the managed migration review.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Immigration Review' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/may/19/immigration-review'></outline>

      <outline id='2580351' text='The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (Lord Rooker)&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08434"&gt;My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08435"&gt;The Housing Bill introduces measures to help to create a fairer and more effective housing market, and will protect those that are most vulnerable in that market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08436"&gt;The Government have listened carefully during Commons consideration of the Bill and to external stakeholders. We now plan to add two further measures to the Bill: provisions to tackle empty homes; and measures to protect tenancy deposits. These amendments will be tabled in due course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08437"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Empty homes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08438"&gt;The Government are committed to finding ways of bringing empty homes back into use. We have already encouraged voluntary measures wherever possible, but recognise that more is needed to reduce significantly the number of privately owned homes that remain vacant for long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08439"&gt;The Government therefore intend to enable local authorities to make management orders in respect of long-term empty homes. The legislation will contain the evidence a local authority would need to provide in support of an application to make a management order on an empty home. We will ensure intervention is proportionate, appropriately targeted and compliant with the Human Rights Act. Voluntary arrangements will continue to be appropriate in many circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08440"&gt;Empty homes management orders would support measures to increase housing supply. We will set out the precise scope of intervention in legislation. Our intention is to apply this measure to genuine cases of housing vacancy. We do not consider it would be appropriate to apply it to property that is genuinely occupied, albeit not on a regular basis, or property subject to an action that will result in it coming back into use without the need for intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS34&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08441"&gt;A management order would enable a local authority to put in place arrangements to enable a property to be let. In the case of a dilapidated property, this might entail renovation. The legal estate would be retained by the owner who would be entitled to any rental income generated by the local authority after deduction of its relevant costs. The owner would be entitled to sell the property or request revocation of the management order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08442"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tenancy deposit protection&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08443"&gt;The Government also propose to add to the Housing Bill some provisions on tenancy deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08444"&gt;The Government remain of the view that providing a link between the safeguarding of tenancy deposits and a requirement for all tenants to have written agreements is a sensible objective. However it accepts that the Law Commission proposals on tenure reform will take time to put into effect and need careful consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08445"&gt;Our intention is to add provisions to the Housing Bill to require that tenancy deposits should be subject to safeguarding arrangements. The Government accept that we will need to sponsor a scheme to provide for the safeguarding of the deposits sought by the majority of landlords. But we also recognise that members of trade or professional bodies should be able to look to those bodies to provide their own schemes if these schemes provide sufficient protection and the Government are able to approve them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08446"&gt;The provisions will need to define the term &apos;&apos;tenancy deposit" and provide that where such deposits are required by landlords or their agents they should be safeguarded by a scheme approved by the Government. There will need to be civil sanctions for non-compliance. There will need to be provisions for the timely return of deposits and for their repayment following dispute resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08447"&gt;These measures on empty homes and tenancy deposits follow extensive consultation with the key stakeholders, and there will be an opportunity for further debate when they are tabled for inclusion in the Housing Bill.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Housing Bill: Empty Homes and Tenancy Deposits' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/may/19/housing-bill-empty-homes-and-tenancy'></outline>

Already over half of all households receive digital television services. In view of the progress to date, switchover between 2006 and 2010 remains attainable. However it is apparent that more concerted action by broadcasters, retailers and manufacturers, supported&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0661P0I1051"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS35&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;by government and Ofcom, is required if the full benefits of digital television are to be made available to the whole population within the desired period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08450"&gt;Completing the switch to digital will bring significant benefits to consumers, to broadcasters and to the UK economy as a whole:&#x000A;&lt;ul&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;It will bring digital terrestrial television signals to the 25 per cent of the population who live in areas that cannot currently receive them because of spectrum limitations;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Increased quality and choice for viewers;&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Broadcasters will no longer have to incur the costs of transmitting signals in both formats, releasing resources for investment in programming and other services for consumers; and&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Spectrum will be released to allow the development of more television and other services for consumers.&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08451"&gt;The BBC and the commercial public service broadcasters have a lead role in achieving switchover. They have an established relationship with virtually all Britain&apos;s households and are therefore uniquely placed to ensuring a smooth transition to digital broadcasting. They will also benefit from reduced costs and from the ability to offer consumers a wider range of services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS36&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08452"&gt;The Government have now written to the commercial terrestrial broadcasters and the BBC inviting them to engage with us and with Ofcom on how to achieve a complete switchover and to establish an appropriate timetable, in liaison with other stakeholders. The outcome of these discussions will be reflected in the digital licences which Ofcom will grant to ITV companies, Channels 4 and 5, and in the BBC&apos;s Charter review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0661P0-08453"&gt;Further stages in establishing the plan for switchover will be reported to the House in due course.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Digital Television' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2004/may/19/digital-television'></outline>
