          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0660P0-05610">My Statements of 19 January and 5 February gave details of a review process established following the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case of Angela Cannings. I wish to inform the House of progress.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_56ws' title='Col. 56WS &mdash; HL Deb 05 May 2004 vol 660 c56WS' name='column_56ws' href='#column_56ws' rel='bookmark'>56WS</a><p id="S5LV0660P0-05611">The review process is now well advanced. A thorough search to identify all potentially relevant cases has been undertaken, and the process has been extended to include cases involving carers. These measures have resulted in an increase in the total number of cases subject to review from 258 to 298.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05612">To ensure thorough and independent scrutiny of all cases, a three-stage review process has been established. Every case file is subject to a preliminary review by a Crown Prosecution Service area to ascertain its key characteristics. Cases are then passed to a central review team comprising prosecutors who are highly experienced in complex criminal casework. A smaller number of cases are then referred to an interdepartmental group, for a final decision on whether the legal representatives of the convicted persons should be notified that there may be features in a case that warrant further consideration by the Court of Appeal or the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The interdepartmental group works under my direction, and includes representatives from the police, Crown Prosecution Service and Criminal Cases Review Commission.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05613">Reviews have been completed in 97 cases. In 38 of these the person convicted is still serving a custodial sentence.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05614">A significant further number of cases are at an advanced stage of review.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05615">Letters have been sent to the legal representatives of five convicted persons, notifying them that it may be appropriate for the safety of their clients' convictions to be considered further by the Court of Appeal or, if appropriate, the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Two of those convicted are sentenced to life imprisonment and remain in custody. Two have already unsuccessfully sought to appeal their convictions.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05616">I have made the Court of Appeal aware of the action I am taking and have liaised closely with the chairman of the Criminal Cases Review Commission to ensure that any cases referred to these bodies will be treated expeditiously. My office stands ready to refer appropriate case files to the CCRC.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05617">The fact that a case has been referred to legal representatives of the convicted person does not amount to a positive determination that their conviction is unsafe. Should any appeals result from this review, it will be for the Crown Prosecution Service to decide independently whether to contest the appeal.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05618">Sixteen live cases were identified by the CPS as potentially affected by the Cannings judgment. Fifteen have been reviewed. Two cases have been discontinued: a Hampshire case discontinued before trial and a Coventry case discontinued before retrial.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05619">It would not be appropriate to place in the public domain the names of defendants or convicted persons in these cases. This will be a decision for them, following advice from their legal representatives.</p><p id="S5LV0660P0-05620">CPS areas, the central review team and the interdepartmental group continue to accord this work the highest priority. I am determined that the review

          should he completed as soon as possible, to bring to an end this period of uncertainty for all those involved. I shall keep the House informed of further progress.</p>
