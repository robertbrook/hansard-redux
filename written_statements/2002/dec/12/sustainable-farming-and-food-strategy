          <cite class='member author entry-title'><a href="/people/miss-margaret-jackson" title="Miss Margaret Jackson">The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Margaret Beckett):</a></cite>
          <p class="first-para"> I am pleased to report to the House that Government are today launching a Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food. Later today, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and I will meet farmers and leaders of the food industry, rural, environmental and consumer bodies to discuss the new strategy and hear examples of good practice from across the food chain.</p><p>The strategy is further evidence of this Government's commitment to help deliver innovative and practical solutions to the challenges faced by those involved in the food chain. We do not underestimate the scale of these challenges: farm incomes remain under pressure and the foot and mouth disease outbreak also added to the momentum for change.</p><p>This strategy builds on the invaluable work conducted by the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food to chart a way through these challenges. It sets out how industry, Government and consumers can work together to secure a profitable and internationally competitive future for our industries, whilst contributing to a better environment, improving nutrition and public health and prosperous communities.</p><p>The strategy is backed by &#x00A3;500 million from Government over the next three years. Subject to clearance under the usual EU procedures, this will provide:
          <q>a new entry-level agri-environment scheme: developing a simple scheme, suitable for all farmers which will pay them to farm in a more sustainable way, a core Curry Commission recommendation. Subject to successful piloting, this would be rolled out nationally in 2005.</q>
          <q>Continued expansion of premium rural and environmental schemes like Countryside Stewardship: further work to improve the targeting of these schemes and make them simpler to applicants.</q>
          <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_26ws' title='Col. 26WS &mdash; HC Deb 12 December 2002 vol 396 c26WS' name='column_26ws' href='#column_26ws' rel='bookmark'>26WS</a>
          A new 'whole farm' approach to management and regulation: helping farmers plan their business as a whole to meet commercial and regulatory needs. The Government also plan to develop an audit-based approach to identify a farm's strengths and weaknesses as a basis for cutting red tape and the number of inspections required.
          <q>The new Agricultural Development Scheme: to improve competitiveness and marketing, including the priority areas of co-operation, farm assurance and spreading best practice.</q>
          <q>New funding to assist small regional food producers: extra money channelled through Food from Britain will enable it to work with Regional Development Agencies and the Regional Food Groups to expand this sector.</q>
          <q>More money for skills and training: knowing how to make a profit is fundamental, but respecting the environment and marketing require different skills and knowledge. We are reviewing training and advice services to help farmers develop and to exploit new opportunities.</q>
          <q>A Food and Health Action Plan: led by the Department of Health, to build on existing work to improve diet and nutrition, working with industry and consumers. The Plan will address food production and access as well as consumer information.</q>
          <q>A network of demonstration farms: in early 2003 a pilot network of farms will open their doors to share best practice and experiences.</q>
          <q>Improving animal health and combating diseases: government is drawing up a new animal health and welfare strategy, has strengthened our emergency preparations and efforts to combat illegal meat imports.</q></p><p>In addition, the Government will ask the Institute of Grocery Distribution, in conjunction with the Food Chain Centre to undertake analysis of the impact of nutrition initiatives such as the National School Fruit Scheme and the five-a-day programme, on the food chain. This will highlight the commercial opportunities for English farmers and growers and other sectors of the food industry.</p><p>The strategy&#x2014;which builds on the work of the Curry Commission&#x2014;also underlines the need for farming to reconnect with its markets, better cooperation with the food chain, investment in people and technology and the adoption of environmental best practice. There are many examples of good practice to build upon:
          <q>More than 25,000 farm holdings in existing government environmental schemes.</q>
          <q>More than 400 farmers' markets offering producers the opportunity to sell direct to their markets.</q>
          <q>Over 78,000 farmers and growers are already members of farm assurance schemes with their produce branded under logos such as the Red Tractor and a number of industry initiatives being taken forward as part of the strategy:</q>
          <q>The Food Chain Centre is working to improve the efficiency of the food chain through the provision of information, analysis and training and promotion of benchmarking and best practice.</q>
          <q>The Red Meat Industry Forum is working to improve efficiency and information flow in the red meat supply chain.</q>
          <q>English Farming and Food Partnerships, established by the industry with Defra support, will promote cooperation between farmers and between farmers and the rest of the food chain.</q>
          <q>Assured Food Standards is working to broaden support for farm assurance within the food chain and to consolidate and develop assurance standards.</q></p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_27ws' title='Col. 27WS &mdash; HC Deb 12 December 2002 vol 396 c27WS' name='column_27ws' href='#column_27ws' rel='bookmark'>27WS</a><p>The Government have already announced that an independent Implementation Group, led by Sir Don Curry, will oversee the delivery of the strategy by both Government and industry.</p><p>Across England, regional delivery plans will be drawn up between government offices, Regional Development Agencies, local farmers, Rural Affairs Forums, Regional Chambers and a range of stakeholders, assisted by Sir Don Curry's Implementation Group.</p><p>The strategy is being laid before Parliament at 11.00am today and copies of this and the strategy related documents will be available in the Vote Office and the Libraries of the House at that time.</p>
