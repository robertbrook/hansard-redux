        Provide a report to the responsible Ministers (the Secretary of State, Lord Chancellor and Attorney-General) every six months. The Ministers will place these reports before Parliament and publish them (subject to the omission of any parts whose laying or publication would, in their opinion, be against the public interest or which might jeopardise the safety of any person). Such reports will include:
        <q>an account of the progress which has been achieved in implementing the planned changes; and</q>
        <q>the Commissioner's observations on how any delays in implementation have arisen and how they might be addressed.</q>
        Meet (at the Commissioner's discretion) with other relevant organisations or agencies, including the political parties and community leaders, to discuss progress in the implementation of the criminal justice changes.
