          <p class="first-para">The Stage 1 Report of the Quinquennial Review (QQR) of the Defence Intelligence and Security Centre (DISC) Defence Agency has today been published and copies of the report placed in the Libraries of the House.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_58ws' title='Col. 58WS &mdash; HC Deb 18 December 2002 vol 396 c58WS' name='column_58ws' href='#column_58ws' rel='bookmark'>58WS</a><p>I announced terms of reference for Stage 1 of this review in the reply I gave on 20 July 2001 (Official Report, column 710W) to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow Maryhill (Ms McKechin).</p><p>In line with central guidance on QQRs, the principal question addressed during Stage 1 has been whether the Ministry of Defence continues to require an in-house intelligence and security training capability The clear conclusion from Stage 1 is that the provision of defence intelligence and security training is essential; the events of September 11 and subsequent operational activity has confirmed this. Following careful analysis of the current arrangements for delivering this training and taking into account the requirements and views of training sponsors and customers, it is clear that the DISC remains a cost effective means of delivering this function.</p><p>The study concluded that the Agency performs this function well, but identified two issues that have reduced its overall effectiveness. These relate to the dual role of the Chief Executive (who is also Director of the (Army) Intelligence Corps) and to a lack of clarity around the margins of the Agency's function concerning the provision of operational manpower and of policy type advice. The study has clarified that the core role of the DISC should be the provision of intelligence and security training The QQR team addressed this in its Stage 2 work and identified a range of specific solutions to these issues.</p><p>In relation to the issue of dual-hatting, the Agency's Owner has already taken steps to mitigate diversion of the Chief Executive's (CE) efforts. A separate study has been commissioned to review the Command and Control arrangements for the DISC and for Intelligence Corps units, and to develop a framework for the command and control of the DISC that will separate the appointments and thereby de-conflict the various responsibilities of the CE. This will provide a clear distinction between the CE as a customer and as a provider, removing any confusion or conflict between the two roles. The study will report in February 2003 and its findings will inform both the DISC Key Targets for Financial Year 2003&#x2013;04 and bids for funding.</p><p>In relation to a lack of clarity around the margins of the Agency's function, the Owner is also taking steps over the next few months to transfer the Agency's operational role. The precise timing and nature of this will be determined as part of implementation of the recommendations of the Strategic Defence Review New Chapter. Additionally, the Owner has taken action to constrain the extent to which the DISC provides advice on intelligence matters to a level that is commensurate with its training role.</p><p>The study also noted that the central issues affecting the core role of the DISC must be considered in the context of implementing the pan-MOD Defence Training Review (DTR) and the two strands of work cooperated closely throughout the QQR. DTR will rationalise the provision of individual education and training in MOD, including intelligence and security

          training and is thus approaching the functions of the DISC from a broader perspective. Recent decisions on the early implementation of DTR at Chicksands have increased the significance of this work The proposed joint Security, Languages, Intelligence and Photography (SLIP) Defence Training Establishment (DTE) that will subsume the DISC is to be implemented with effect from April 2003 as an early demonstration of the progress towards rationalisation that DTR will bring.</p><p>We have concluded that the DISC should remain an Agency within MOD, in view of the benefits of rationalised training and increased visibility and accountability this has already delivered. In addition to the Stage 2 work described above, additional work has been completed on improving the Agency's Key Targets and on investigating the potential for increasing the application of E-Learning to intelligence and security training, which is consistent with recommendations of the Defence Training Review. This will enable the Agency to achieve its full potential as a centre of training excellence.</p>

          <p class="first-para">The Key Targets proposed for the Defence Intelligence and Security Centre (DISC) Defence Agency for Financial Year 2002ߝ03 have been agreed, following consideration of the recommendations of the Quinquennial Review of DISC, the findings of which have now been announced to Parliament. These are the targets the Agency has been working to throughout this year.</p><p>The role of the DISC is to train the Armed Forces and other Intelligence agencies in intelligence and security disciplines, and conduct after capture; to maintain an operational capability; and to contribute effective and timely advice to the Armed Forces on appropriate intelligence and security training matters. The Key Targets for the Agency for the 12 months from April 2002 are:</p><p><span class="italic">Key Target 1&#x2014;Training OutputߞQuantity</span></p><p>To deliver, within the resources available, the agreed Training Programme and to establish an accurate baseline of the number of successfully completed Man Training Days (MTDs) within the Systems Approach to Training (SAT) process, to be used for comparative measurement in Financial Year (FY) 2003ߝ04.</p><p><span class="italic">Key Target 2ߞTraining Quality</span></p><p>To ensure that at least 80 per cent. of Training courses complete Internal Validation, to introduce a programme of External Validation, and to complete at least 10 per cent. of External Validations within FY 2002ߝ03, through the application of the Systems Approach to Training (SAT) methodology.</p><p><span class="italic">Key Target 3ߞEfficiency</span></p><p>To reduce the current cost of delivering the average training place made available by 2 per cent. (&#x00A3;3 per day) in FY 2002ߝ03, and to establish the average cost of a successfully completed MTD to be used as a measurement from FY 2003ߝ04.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_60ws' title='Col. 60WS &mdash; HC Deb 18 December 2002 vol 396 c60WS' name='column_60ws' href='#column_60ws' rel='bookmark'>60WS</a><p><span class="italic">Key Target 4ߞOperations</span></p><p>To satisfy the operational tasking of the Defence Debriefing Team (DDT) and the Field HUMINT Team (FHT).</p>
