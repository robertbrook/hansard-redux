          <p class="first-para"> The sixth report to Parliament on the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme (PPRS) was published today.</p><p>The report, entitled "PPRS: Sixth Report to Parliament", covers the management and operation of the 1999 scheme, which was introduced in October 1999 including the delivery of the 4.5 per cent. price cut. It explains the Government's objectives for the scheme and gives consolidated information on company annual financial returns. The report sets out the contribution made to the economy by the UK based pharmaceutical industry and sets out the conclusions of the joint Department of Health and Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) study into the extent of competition in the supply of branded medicines to the National Health Service.</p><p>Copies of the report have been placed in the Library.</p>
