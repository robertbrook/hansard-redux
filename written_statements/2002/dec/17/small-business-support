          <p class="first-para">The Small Business Service (SBS) is today publishing a new policy framework for small business entitled 'Small Business and Governmentﬂûthe Way Forward'. I am placing copies in the Libraries of both Houses.</p><p>The framework represents a focusing of the Government's small firms policy on seven core themes: building an enterprise culture; encouraging a more dynamic start-up market; building the capability for small business growth; improving access to finance for small businesses; encouraging more enterprise in disadvantaged communities and under represented groups; improving small businesses experience of Government services; and developing better regulation and policy. These will be built into seven national strategies to make a reality of the Government's vision for the small business sector. The Government wants more people to have the ambition of starting their own business, and for all those who take that step to have every chance of succeeding. Our aims are:
          <q>Many more people, regardless of their background, having the desire, skills and opportunity to start a successful business;</q>
          <q>Everyone with the ambition to grow their business being helped and supported;</q>
          <q>A supportive business environment with all small businesses finding it easy to respond to Government and access its services.</q></p><p>The framework is designed to ensure a coherent engagement between the whole of Government and the small business sector. It stresses that small businesses are the responsibility of all of Government and not just one Department. All parts of Government will have contributions to make to the seven strategies.</p><p>The framework envisages a strong role for the SBS as a centre of expertise on small business issues based on its experience of delivering services to this particular community and its extensive research base and network of contacts. This expertise will be used by the whole of Government in developing policies and services which affect small businesses.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_45ws' title='Col. 45WS &mdash; HC Deb 17 December 2002 vol 396 c45WS' name='column_45ws' href='#column_45ws' rel='bookmark'>45WS</a><p>The policy framework follows on from the joint Treasury and SBS paper, 'Enterprise Britain: a modern approach to meeting the Enterprise Challenge' published in November 2002.</p>
