          <p class="first-para">On Thursday 5 December 2002 I presented the draft Settlement for 2003&#x2013;04. Included in the announcement was the amount available of non-domestic rates in England for 2003&#x2013;04 to be redistributed to local authorities. This statement details the calculation of the Distributable Amount and announces the non-domestic rate poundage (multiplier) for 2003&#x2013;04.</p><p>The multiplier will be 44.4 pence. The amount of non-domestic rates in England for 2003&#x2013;04 to be redistributed to local authorities will be &#x00A3;15,600 million.</p><p>The calculations for 2003&#x2013;04, and the prior-year figures, on which this is based, are set out in the following table.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_3ws' title='Col. 3WS &mdash; HC Deb 09 December 2002 vol 396 c3WS' name='column_3ws' href='#column_3ws' rel='bookmark'>3WS</a><p><table>
