          <p class="first-para">The Department for Education and Skills, in co-operation with the Learning and Skills Council, has conducted an investigation into allegations that the Principal and Corporation of Tameside College did wilfully and against legal advice conduct its business in a manner not in accordance with its Instrument and Articles of Government.</p><p>The investigation has reported that those allegations are confirmed. In particular that:
          <q>insufficient written notice was given of a meeting to discuss the removal of the Clerk to the Corporation and, subsequently, the motion of no confidence in the then Chair of the Corporation;</q>
          <q>the appropriate 'Special Committee' process was not carried out in removing the Clerk to the Corporation;</q>
          <q>contrary to rules of governance, the Principal remained at, and actively participated in, the meeting removing the Clerk to the Corporation; and</q>
          <q>again contrary to rules of governance, the Staff Member of the Corporation was excluded from participation in the motion of no confidence in the then Chair of the Corporation.</q></p><p>As a consequence, I have written to the Chair of the Corporation strongly censuring the Corporation's activities in breach of corporate governance and requiring the Corporation to conduct its future business in strict accordance with its Instrument and Articles of Government. I have also written to the Learning and Skills Council asking it to appoint an additional Member to the Corporation to ensure that it does so. I will review this arrangement after one year.</p>
