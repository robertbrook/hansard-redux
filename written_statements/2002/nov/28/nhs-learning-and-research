          <p class="first-para">On 13 June 2002, my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath) announced a joint Ministerial review of education, training and research in the National Health Service in order to ensure that new management structures are working effectively, and committed the Government to announcing the terms of reference for this review before the end of the year.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_51ws' title='Col. 51WS &mdash; HC Deb 28 November 2002 vol 395 c51WS' name='column_51ws' href='#column_51ws' rel='bookmark'>51WS</a><p>My noble Friend Lord Hunt, my hon. Friend the Minister of State for Lifelong Learning and Higher Education, Department for Education and Skills (Mrs Hodge), Ms Jane Hutt, Minister for Health and Social Services at the National Assembly for Wales and I have agreed the terms of reference. Prominent among the issues that led to the announcement of the review was that primary care trusts (PCTs) in their effort to deliver improved local patient care also focussed on education and research. The terms of reference directly tackle this concern and are, in the light of the <a href="/acts/national-health-service-reform-and-health-care-professions-act-2002">National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002</a>, to:
          <q>review the role of PCTs in ensuring the right balance is struck between care for NHS patients, learning and research;</q>
          <q>consider the responsibilities of PCTs in supporting research and learning across all health care professions in the NHS and identify those responsibilities that are proving difficult to achieve;</q>
          <q>report to Ministers by December 2003, including any recommendations for action that may be required to enable PCTs to discharge their responsibilities more effectively; and</q>
          <q>advise how the findings might inform the process of implementing local health boards in Wales and the Welsh Assembly's strategy on continuing professional development.</q></p><p>In line with commitments already given by my noble Friend Lord Hunt, the review will:
          <q>be carried out jointly by the Department of Health, Department for Education and Skills and the National Assembly for Wales;</q>
          <q>be overseen by Ministers from each Department;</q>
