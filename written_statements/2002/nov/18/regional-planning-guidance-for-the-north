          <p class="first-para">"Regional Planning Guidance for the North East (RPG1) is being published today.</p><p>RPG1 sets out the spatial development strategy that encompasses proposals for the development of the region's economy, housing, transport infrastructure, and other land uses. The priority of the strategy is to direct the majority of new development to the built up areas of the Tyne, Wear and Tees conurbations, and adopt a sequential approach to identifying sites for development to ensure that development is located in the most sustainable locations. RPG1 also sets out proposals for the conservation, management and enhancement of the region's natural and cultural environment.</p><p>I am pleased that much of the vision, objectives and core strategy of RPG1 carries forward to a great extent what was proposed in the original draft RPG prepared by the Association of North East Councils (ANEC). RPG1 reflects the effective working that was achieved between ANEC, local authorities, the Regional Development Agency, One NorthEast, and other stakeholders, all of whom have made valuable contributions to refine and enhance the original draft guidance. It builds on the inclusive process for preparing RPG that the Government has put in place. Many of the comments received in response to the consultations carried out earlier have made a positive contribution to the overall strategy for sustainable development and have been taken on board.</p><p>The North East Assembly, which now has the role of Regional Planning Body, will work with partners to ensure its effective implementation, monitoring and review."</p>
