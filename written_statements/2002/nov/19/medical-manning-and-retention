          <p class="first-para">The Medical Manning and Retention Review has recently been completed. It was conducted inclusively, with the involvement of the British Medical and Dental Associations and NHS representation. The Review was undertaken against the background of serious manning shortfalls among medical and dental officers in the Defence Medical Services (DMS). It complements the work of the Medical Quinquennial Review (MQR) and its recommendations will be taken forward in parallel with those of the MQR. The Review will inform the Ministry of Defence paper of evidence to the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) for the 2003 pay round.</p><p>The Review has involved a detailed examination of the manning requirement and how this should be met. It has also examined the factors which influence medical and dental officer manning and, to assist in this, an independent human resources consultant was employed to obtain the views of serving medical and dental officers and those who had recently left the Armed Forces. As part of the Review, comparisons were made with pay and conditions of service in the NHS and other potential areas of employment. The MOD's existing proposals for aligning the terms of service of medical and dental officers across the three Services were also re-examined.</p><p>The Review concluded that three main issues needed to be addressed if the necessary improvements in recruitment and retention were to be achieved: overstretch; pay and pensions; and the quality of life. It made a number of recommendations covering both remuneration and non-financial issues. The main recommendations are:
          <q>New pay arrangements, endorsed by the AFPRB, which will form the basis for our evidence on medical and dental officers' pay to the AFPRB early in the New Year. It is planned that the new pay structure will be implemented in two phases; the first, which contains most of the changes, with effect from 1 April 2003, and the second with effect from 1 April 2004;</q>
          <q>Interim improvements to the pension arrangements for DMS medical and dental officers in advance of the introduction of a final salary scheme for all military personnel around 2005&#x2013;6;</q>
