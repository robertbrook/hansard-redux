          <p class="first-para">We want to encourage people to stand as local councillors. We recognise their voluntary contribution as an important aspect of public life. We recognise that this commitment can be time-consuming, and therefore welcome employers encouraging their employees to serve as councillors by allowing them paid time-off to carry out their council duties.</p><p>The Electoral Commission has published its view that, under Schedule 7 to the <a href="/acts/political-parties-elections-and-referendums-act-2000-1">Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act 2000</a> ("the Act"), the provision of such paid time-off should be treated as a political donation to the employee in his or her capacity as a holder of elective office. On the basis of this view, the value of such paid time-off must be reported to the Commission, where the total is more than &#x00A3;1,000 for each employee in the course of a year. In addition, employees will not lawfully be able to accept such paid time-off from their employers where these are not "permissible donors" under the Act.</p><p>The Government accepts that there has been uncertainty surrounding the issue. However, the Government's long-standing policy is that the provisions of the Act should not apply to the receipt by a councillor of paid time-off for carrying out his or her duty as a councillor. It would be clearly wrong for some employers not to be able to offer paid time-off to their employees to serve as councillors. Moreover requirements on other employers, and in some cases their employees, to calculate and to report the value of such paid time-off to the Electoral Commission would be a disincentive for employers from supporting employees who wish to serve as councillors.</p><p>Consequently, we are proposing to include in the <a href="/bills/local-government-bill">Local Government Bill</a>, announced on 13 November in the Queen's Speech, amendments to Schedule 7 to the <a href="/acts/political-parties-elections-and-referendums-act-2000">Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000</a>. The effect of these amendments would be to exclude the value of any salary paid to an employee by an employer in respect of time-off taken in order to undertake duties as a local councillor from the definition of a donation in Schedule 7 to the Act. This would mean that it will be open to all employers to grant such paid time-off, and that the value of such time-off would not have to be reported to the Electoral Commission.</p><p>We are providing for these amendments to apply with retrospective effect, so that any paid time-off which might have been granted to councillors since 16 February 2001, when the requirements of Schedule 7 to Act came into force, is not to be considered as a political donation.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_12ws' title='Col. 12WS &mdash; HC Deb 19 November 2002 vol 394 c12WS' name='column_12ws' href='#column_12ws' rel='bookmark'>12WS</a>
