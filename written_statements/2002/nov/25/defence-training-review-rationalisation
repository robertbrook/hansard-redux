          <p class="first-para">Further to my written answer of 19 July 2001,<span class="italic">Official Report</span>, column 334&#x2014;35W scoping studies have confirmed that operational benefits, and significant savings, could be achieved by rationalising a number of specialist training streams along defence, rather than single-service lines. The studies identified benchmark options for providing the different types of training at existing MOD sites to serve as public sector comparators, against which a wider range of options can be considered. These will include partnering with the private sector, where potential private sector providers will be encouraged to propose innovative solutions, which might include proposals to establish training establishments on completely new sites. The selection, therefore, by a study of a benchmark site does not imply that the MOD has taken a firm decision to continue training on that site.</p><p>The sites being examined for these benchmarks or public sector comparators are HMS Sultan for electro-mechanical engineering training; RAF Cosford for aeronautical engineering training; the Defence School of Transport at Leconfield for logistic training; the Defence Intelligence and Security Centre at Chicksands for security, intelligence, language and photography training; the Royal School of Signals at Blandford for communications and information systems training; and RAF Halton for joint personnel administration and police training.</p><p>There are implications for other MOD sites at which elements of this training are currently being carried out. Sites where training may cease, and for which no alternative military use is currently envisaged, are: Bordon, Arborfield, Deepcut, Lodge Hill & Chattenden, St Omer, Chichester, Worthy Down and Beaconsfield. Sites where some of the current training activity may be relocated are: Chatham, Marchwood, St Athan, RAF Cranwell, Shrivenham, HMS Collingwood (Gosport), RAF Digby, RAF Benson, RAF Brize Norton, Chatham, Grantham, Lympstone, Plymouth (including HMS Raleigh), Stafford, West Moors, Portsmouth and Wethersfield.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_2ws' title='Col. 2WS &mdash; HC Deb 25 November 2002 vol 395 c2WS' name='column_2ws' href='#column_2ws' rel='bookmark'>2WS</a><p>The next stage of this work is to engage with industry to explore procurement options and to determine the most appropriate and cost-effective means of delivering this rationalised specialist training. Once this work is completed we will have a clearer picture of the likely locations of the various Defence Schools, and will be able to offer a more detailed assessment of the implications for other sites.</p><p>Firm decisions on the future use of the sites will be made in the light of the evaluation of the options that emerge from our engagement with industry, and following the normal consultative process.</p><p>I have written to right hon. and hon. Members whose constituencies may be affected by these proposals.</p>
