          <p class="first-para">The provision for the Government Indemnity Scheme is made by the <a href="/acts/national-heritage-act-1980">National Heritage Act 1980</a>. The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non-national institutions. It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to their loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing institutions, where this would contribute materially to the public's understanding or appreciation of the loan. Examples of this are: enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects, or bringing into the public domain the conclusions of any study.</p><p>In the six month period ended 30 September, the following undertakings to indemnify were given under section 16 by the relevant Departments for objects on loan to national and non-national institutions:
