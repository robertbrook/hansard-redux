The 2004 spending review settlement has provided the department with almost &#x00A3;15 billion to spend on the railways over its three year period. This is an increase of &#x00A3;1.9 billion over previously published plans, averaging at 15 per cent per year.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04784">This Statement sets out how the Department for Transport intends to allocate this money on the railways until April 2009, which is the end of the current control period for rail.

          </p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04789">These figures show Network Rail progressing towards much greater financial stability. In particular, its need for additional borrowing will decline dramatically in 2006&#x2013;2007 and continue to reduce until the end of the current control period. Network Rail is funded through the network grant, paid direct by government; access charges paid for use of the network by private train and freight operating companies; and other income from activities such as property and retail. In the current year it is forecast that 47 per cent of Network Rail funding will be from the public sector, and 53 per cent from the private sector (44 per cent from train operating companies and 9 per cent other income, including freight access charges).</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04790">Network Rail also has the capacity to borrow. As at September 2004 Network Rail reported a net debt of &#x00A3;14.3 billion. The interim review by the Rail Regulator, and supported by the Government's spending plans, ties Network Rail into achieving efficiency savings of some 30 per cent by 2009. Nevertheless, its plans for the four-year period in the above table include the replacement of 3,360 kilometres of rail, the renewal of 2,900 kilometres of sleepers and the reduction of train delay minutes by 26 per cent.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04791">The Government's plans provide the best opportunity in a generation to achieve a stable and sustainable funding position for the national railway. In particular, they see rapid investment by Network Rail on infrastructure renewal and investment, delivering on a range of planned projects, improving reliability, and putting right decades of neglect on the basis of properly funded proposals.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04792">Realising this stability in the medium-term will require careful control of costs, particularly over the coming spending review period. In addition to the 30 per cent efficiency savings, Network Rail will need to retain a

          focus first and foremost on the renewal and modernisation of the existing network and demonstrate its improved efficiency before looking at any wide-ranging enhancement programmes. Efficiencies will be required as much on the franchising side as from Network Rail&#x2014;and the costs of rolling stock remain an important part of the equation.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04793">But, the provisions of the <a href="/bills/railways-bill">Railways Bill</a> currently passing through Parliament will enable the Government to fulfil their White Paper commitments, delivering better cost control and greater efficiency. The spending review settlement will enable the Government to tackle the decades of underinvestment and put the railways on a secure footing for the future.</p>
