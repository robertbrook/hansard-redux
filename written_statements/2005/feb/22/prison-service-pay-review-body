          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0669P0-04870">The fourth report of the Prison Service Pay Review Body (PSPRB) on the pay of in-charge governors and operational managers. prison officers and related grades in England and Wales in 2005 has been published today and copies placed in the Library. I would like to thank the chair and members of the PSPR B for their hard work in producing their recommendations.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04871">The PSPRB has recommended a 2.5 per cent basic increase to pay rates for prison officer and related grades and to in-charge governors and other operational managers. It has recommended a slightly higher increase of 3 per cent for senior officers to improve the pay differential for what they regard as an increasingly important operational grade. The basic award of 2.5 per cent is at the same level as the December 2004 figure for all-items inflation excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX). Most in-charge governors and other operational managers receive performance payments on top of their basic award, which contribute to earnings growth for them above the level of inflation. Just under half of all prison officers will also receive increments, adding to earnings growth for them.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04872">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has decided that the recommendations will be implemented in full, with effect from the operative date of the award of 1 April 2005. The cost of the award will be met from within the existing budget allocation for the service.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04873">There is now a pressing need to look, for the next pay round and beyond, at a multi-year settlement to give a framework for Modernisation. This will involve a comprehensive review of existing pay systems to support reform, which is essential to achieving the goals of a Modern service and in enabling it to operate in the new environment of contestability. We have therefore tasked officials to discuss urgently with the pay review body how this can best be achieved against the background, recognised by the review body, of continuing financial constraints. The Home Secretary expects to issue a remit letter to this effect in due course.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04874">The key recommendations of the report are:</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04875">A 2.5 per cent basic increase to pay rates for prison officer and related grades and operational managers from 1 April 2005;</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04876">A 3 per cent basic increase for senior officers from 1 April 2005;</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_57ws' title='Col. 57WS &mdash; HL Deb 22 February 2005 vol 669 c57WS' name='column_57ws' href='#column_57ws' rel='bookmark'>57WS</a><p id="S5LV0669P0-04877">An increase of 6 per cent to the maxima and minima of the pay scales for senior operational managers;</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04878">No change to local pay allowance rates from 1 April 2005. These remain at:</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04879">&#x00A3;4,000 per annum for the "top" rate (mainly London)</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04880">&#x00A3;3,100 per annum for the "high" rate</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04881">&#x00A3;2,600 per annum for the "middle" rate</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04882">&#x00A3;1,100 per annum for the "lower" rate</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04883">Required hours addition for operational managers to be increased by the basic award figure (2.5 per cent);</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04884">Healthcare specialist allowance increased by 2.5 per cent but all others frozen at current rates; and</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04885">All other allowances (tornado, bedwatch, on call, dirty protest, etc) increased by 2.5 per cent except for the care and maintenance of dogs allowance to be increased by 1 per cent.</p>
