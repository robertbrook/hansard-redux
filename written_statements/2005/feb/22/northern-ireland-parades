          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0669P0-04809">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04810">I have been considering Sir George Quigley's review of parades. the subsequent consultation on his report, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee (NIAC) report of January this year and the events of last summer. Each of these offers different perspectives on how to go forward and I have come to a balanced decision about how to respond.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04811">I have decided that a case has not been made to make fundamental changes to parading arrangements in Northern Ireland. Parades have been increasingly peaceful over the past few years. The number of contentious parades has fallen. Out of approximately 2,000 parades notified last year, only 200 were regarded as "contentious" and two resulted in serious public order incidents. I think this shows the success of the arrangements we have here in reducing tension. I want to echo the words of NIAC, which concluded that the Parades Commission remains the best hope for developing the peaceful resolution of disputes. I will therefore not be pressing forward with the changes recommended by Sir George Quigley at this time. I am, however, indebted to Sir George for his insightful and</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_50ws' title='Col. 50WS &mdash; HL Deb 22 February 2005 vol 669 c50WS' name='column_50ws' href='#column_50ws' rel='bookmark'>50WS</a><p id="S5LV0669P0-04812">Northern Ireland has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04813">Subject to parliamentary approval the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) will be taking a 2004&#x2013;05 spring Supplementary Estimate. The effect this will have is to increase the NIO's DEL by &#x00A3;47,954,000 from &#x00A3;1,236,190,000 to &#x00A3;1,284,144,000. Within the DEL change, the impact on resource and capital is as set out in the following table.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04814">intelligent contribution to the debate around parades in Northern Ireland. Although I am not adopting his recommendations, my thinking has been greatly influenced by his work and I am indebted to him for his insightful and intelligent contribution to the debate around parades in Northern Ireland.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04815">I shall be laying an Order in Council to amend the law on parades. The order makes clear that the Parades Commission can make determinations that include supporters and followers. Some doubts have been raised about the commission's remit. The police and NIAC have asked me to put the matter beyond doubt before the summer.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04816">At the same time, I intend to take on board Quigley and NIAC's recommendation that parades and related protests should be considered by the same body. The order will bring protestors within the remit of the Parades Commission. I have been persuaded that the time is right for the Parades Commission to take on this function.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04817">I am also launching a wide-ranging consultation exercise on mediation. I think there is a great deal of potential for mediation to help defuse the tensions surrounding parades and I firmly believe that agreed outcomes are the best way to resolve disputes. However, there has not been agreement about how best to deliver mediation. I have today published a consultation paper on these issues. The consultation will close on 23 May 2005.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04818">The NIAC's report contained other recommendations about how the Parades Commission could make the way it carries out its work more effective. I am aware that the commission is examining these and I look forward to hearing their response.</p>
