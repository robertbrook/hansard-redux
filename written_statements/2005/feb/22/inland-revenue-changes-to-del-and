          the central reserve for continued work on Child Trust Fund and for Team Bonus payments, respectively. HM Treasury is to transfer &#x00A3;99,000, for the cost of capital in respect of the GOGGS East building. Cabinet Office will be transferring &#x00A3;1,790,000, due to the change in funding arrangements for the Parliamentary Counsel Office; and, Department for Work and Pensions is transferring &#x00A3;1,661,000, for child benefit work on the Payment Modernisation Programme and the Child Benefit Cheque Payment Service. These transfers are partially offset by a transfer of &#x00A3;2,964,000 to HM Treasury to meet the costs of the transfer of tax policy work for the first half of the financial year.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-05040">The change in the capital element of the DEL arises from an increase of &#x00A3;97,477,000 from the central reserve to enable the GOGGS East building to be brought onto the department's balance sheet. This increase is partially offset by an accounting adjustment of &#x00A3; 58,364,000, in relation to the assets transferred to CapGemini, the department's new IT service provider.</p>
