The fourteenth STRB report deals with some very important and technical issues affecting teachers' pay and I am most grateful to it for the careful and detailed attention it has given to these complex matters. The STRB recommendations are set out below (in italics) followed in each case by my response.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04942">I am seeking consultation comments on the report and my response by 18 March 2005.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04943"><span class="italic">Payments for additional responsibilities for teaching and learning</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04944">The STRB has recommended the following:</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04945"><span class="italic">We recommend that the following criterion and factors for awarding teaching and learning responsibility (TLR) payments be adopted:</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04946"><span class="italic">The criterion is as follows:</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04947"><span class="italic">A teaching and learning responsibility payment may only be made to a teacher who is accountable for a significant, specified responsibility focused on teaching and learning, that is not required of all classroom teachers, clearly defined in the job description of the teaching and learning responsibility payment holder, and requiring teachers' professional skills and judgement. The TLR payment should be for a sustained responsibility in the context of the school's staffing structure needed to ensure continued delivery of high-quality teaching and learning.</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04948"><span class="italic">The factors are as follows:Impact on educational progress beyond the teacher's assigned pupils;</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04949"><span class="italic">Leading, developing and enhancing the teaching practice of others;</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04950"><span class="italic">Having accountability for leading, managing and developing a subject or curriculum area or pupil</span>

I believe that they represent a genuinely constructive opportunity for schools to organise their teaching and learning responsibilities in a new way, focusing on the professionalism of teachers and enabling reward to be given for significant tasks which have an impact on the educational progress of pupils and the professional practice of other teachers. I am particularly glad to recognise the flexibilities, within an overall framework, recommended within the new teaching and learning responsibility payments system, and the emphasis on openness through the pay policy, which would give schools the freedom to establish the arrangements which suit their own needs, while openly justifying their decisions.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04974">However, I am anxious that all schools should have sufficient time to prepare and consider what staffing structure is most appropriate for them before implementation of these pay changes. To promote clarity and consistency I propose that all schools' transition periods should begin on I January 2006, at which point TLR payments should be available and management allowances would cease to be awarded.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04975">I also welcome the focus on restructuring, which will be key to enabling the transition from the existing management allowance system to be managed. Action on school restructuring in Wales will, of course. be for the Welsh Assembly to determine.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04976">I agree that guidance to schools on restructuring, transition and the new TLR payments system will be very important. However, I believe that the guidance should not be restrictive or suggest different levels of TLR payment for different tasks or responsibilities. I believe that the detailed criteria and factors for the payment of TLRs should be the focus for schools' (and in the case of unattached teachers, LEAs') decisions, and that this should be sufficient to enable them to take appropriate decisions within the context of their own individual published structures. All parties will, as usual, be consulted on the development of statutory guidance.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04977">I agree that the arrangements for the award of TLRs also require provisions for their future cessation and the recommendations of the STRB are sensible and helpful.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_65ws' title='Col. 65WS &mdash; HL Deb 22 February 2005 vol 669 c65WS' name='column_65ws' href='#column_65ws' rel='bookmark'>65WS</a><p id="S5LV0669P0-04978">I welcome the proposed arrangements for transition from management allowances to TLRs, and the proposed provisions giving protections for teachers who would otherwise incur a reduction in salary, which are fair and reasonable.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04979"><span class="italic">Safeguarding arrangements for pay</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04980"><span class="italic">We recommend that:</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04981"><span class="italic">The framework for the operation of safeguarding that we describe below be adopted to apply to both current and future safeguarding arrangements:</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04982"><span class="italic">Framework for the operation of safeguarding</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04983"><span class="italic">A.

          <li><i>e. The teacher must know at the start of the safeguarding period what safeguarding arrangements are applicable to any particular salary element and this must be set out in the teacher's salary statement at the start of the period.</i></li>

I very much welcome the careful and detailed consideration which the STRB has now been able to give to this matter, in the light of evidence received. The proposed safeguarding provisions set out are reasonable and balanced and I support them.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04992">I recognise the difficulties and sensitivities which exist in the context of bringing change to this area of the teachers' pay system, and the framework proposed will enable existing and future safeguarding to be handled on a fair, uniform and predictable basis. Moreover, the framework as proposed will ensure that teachers are protected from sudden drops in total salary which would otherwise occur through no fault of their own, for a suitable period. I also welcome the recommendation of the STRB that these detailed matters are handled in future using my subsidiary powers, within the context of the framework established, which seems to be entirely appropriate.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04993"><span class="italic">Pay arrangements for secondary mathematics and science advanced skills teachers</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04994"><span class="italic">We recommend that:</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04995"><span class="italic">In line with its policy of expanding the AST grade, the department looks at ways of getting more mathematics and science teachers with AST accreditation, but not in an AST post, into such posts, including, where appropriate, the creation of additional AST posts in these subjects;</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04996"><span class="italic">This message be reinforced in the guidance to schools, primary and secondary, on the review of their structures which will take place as part of the transition to the new TLR system; and</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04997"><span class="italic">Schools be encouraged to make greater use af the flexibilities they already have to set AST pay for these two subjects;</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04998"><span class="italic">Paragraph 27.3 of the STPCD be amended so that the factors to which the relevant body has to have regard in setting the range for an AST's pay expressly include his or her being a teacher of a shortage subject or a subject where there is a particular need to raise the quality of teaching and learning.</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-04999">The remit to the STRB invited it to consider the salary levels of secondary mathematics and science advanced skills teachers.

          &#x00A3;40,000. This was proposed as part of the Government's approach to overcoming the national under-achievements in these two subjects and their impact on the economy, as identified in the reports of Professor Adrian Smith and Sir Gareth Roberts.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-05000">The STRB has reflected carefully on this but has concluded that at present it will not make recommendations along the lines proposed. It has indicated that this could be considered further in a future remit, in the wider context of teachers' remuneration as a whole. I continue to see benefits in making changes to the pay arrangements for these teachers in these important subject areas. I therefore am content to return to this matter in my next remit.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-05001">It has also made some specific pay-related proposals which I propose to accept. I will reflect further on the STRB's proposals relating to getting more mathematics and science teachers with an AST accreditation, but not currently in an AST post, into such posts.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-05002"><span class="italic">Excellent Teacher Scheme</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-05003"><span class="italic">We recommend that the scheme should be introduced from September 2006, distinct from the main and upper pay scales. The scheme should be post-based and should be for exemplary classroom teachers with an established record of sustained high-quality teaching and of supporting colleagues within the school. Like ASTs they should be unable to hold TLRs, but unlike ASTs they should have no outreach function. They should:</span>

          <li><i>Continue to maintain high standards;</i></li>
          <li><i>Demonstrate a commitment to develop themselves professionally;</i></li>
          <li><i>Provide an exemplary role model for staff through their professional expertise; and</i></li>
          <li><i>Have a distinctive role in achieving improvements in teaching across the school.</i></li>
          </ul></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-05004"><span class="italic">In addition to their normal classroom duties the specific expectations of an Excellent Teacher should be:</span>

To qualify, the teacher should have to have been paid on U3 for at least two years, be willing to meet the expectations of an Excellent Teacher, and have their application endorsed by their head teacher.

We recommend the following baseline rates for the scheme, as at 1 September 2005: &#x00A3;35,000 in England and Wales, &#x00A3;35,988 in the fringe, &#x00A3;37,832 in outer London, and &#x00A3;41,745 in inner London. We do not think it appropriate at this stage to set a salary for September 2006.</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-05016"><span class="italic">We recommend that the basic structure of this reformed career system remain in its present form the medium term.</span></p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_69ws' title='Col. 69WS &mdash; HL Deb 22 February 2005 vol 669 c69WS' name='column_69ws' href='#column_69ws' rel='bookmark'>69WS</a><p id="S5LV0669P0-05017"><sup>1</sup> <span class="italic">"New Professionalism" as set out in the department's five year strategy, sets out the proposal that career progression and financial rewards should be for those who are:</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-05018"><span class="italic">making the biggest contributions to improving pupil attainment;</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-05019"><span class="italic">continually developing their own expertise; and helping to develop expertise in other teachers.</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-05020"><span class="italic">We recommend a targeted communications exercise to ensure teachers are aware of the reformed career structure and the implications for them.</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-05021"><span class="italic">We recommend that the department monitors actively the bedding down of the ETS and how the ETS and AST schemes are used so the review body can revisit it in three years after the scheme's introduction.</span></p><p id="S5LV0669P0-05022">I welcome the proposed creation of the post-based Excellent Teacher scheme, and believe that the arrangements set out give a firm basis for progress in its introduction.

The same applies to the proposal to develop a separate ETS standard taking account of new professionalism. It is certainly our intention to see the ETS&#x2014;as well as standards for other teachers&#x2014;in this light.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-05024">I believe that the proposal to enable widespread assessment for ETS, regardless of whether a post is available, should be a matter for further consideration and discussion, taking account of the necessity for effective implementation of the scheme. I do, however, have greater concerns about the STRB's concept of naming a teacher as an Excellent Teacher if they have passed assessment, if they are not in a post, while giving a new and separate name to those in post, and suspect that this may cause undue confusion. I would welcome views on this.</p><p id="S5LV0669P0-05025">I note the initial salary outlines recommended, which provide a very helpful steer for the future.
