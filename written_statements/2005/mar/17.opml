Like them, the new patrol vessel will also follow an innovative public/private partnership arrangement for the provision of maritime capability. While manned by the Royal Navy, the department will pay a set monthly fee for the provision of the ship and a guaranteed level of availability, with an incentivised payment structure to ensure that any shortfalls are dealt with promptly and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06043"&gt;The vessel will thus provide a significant increase in availability compared with the old, and increasingly difficult to maintain, Castle class ships that have provided the Falkland Islands patrol capability for the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06044"&gt;It is planned that the ship will enter service in 2007, and be chartered for an initial period up to 2012. Over this period, she will generate in excess of &amp;#x00A3;2 million savings compared with continuing to run the old ships, while providing at least as good an overall capability at a much lower level of risk.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Offshore Patrol Vessel' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/offshore-patrol-vessel'></outline>

We asked the commission to monitor and evaluate the impact of the minimum wage and make recommendations on the need for any change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06058"&gt;The Government arc today publishing the commission&apos;s 2005 report and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the chair of the commission, Adair Turner, and its other members for their work on this very important issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06059"&gt;The main recommendations put forward by the commission concern the rates of the minimum wage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06060"&gt;The commission has first recommended increasing the adult rate of the minimum wage from the present &amp;#x00A3;4.85 to &amp;#x00A3;5.05 in October 2005, and to &amp;#x00A3;5.35 in October 2006, subject to confirmation by the commission in February 2006, to check that the macroeconomic conditions continue to make it appropriate, and in light of the implementation of forthcoming age discrimination legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S5LV0670P0I1065"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 3&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06061"&gt;The final key commission recommendation is that we should introduce interest charges on arrears of underpayment of the minimum wage and impose financial penalties for seriously non-compliant employers. The great majority of employers are either compliant or pay minimum wage arrears without the need for any formal enforcement action. However, the Government understand the underlying point that the commission makes about the need to tackle seriously non-compliant employers more effectively. We are already considering a number of options for improving enforcement and intend to make a Statement on this in early summer. We will consider the point about interest charges in this context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06062"&gt;I would also like to take this opportunity to announce that the Government have decided not to pursue employers where workers are paid below the minimum wage in some pay periods, but above the minimum wage overall. Such action will enable us to concentrate our resources on employers deliberately seeking to pay workers below the minimum wage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06063"&gt;I have placed copies of this Statement, the report from the Low Pay Commission, the Government&apos;s individual response to the commission&apos;s recommendations and our draft regulatory impact assessment in the House Libraries.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Low Pay Commission' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/low-pay-commission'></outline>

      <outline id='2623994' text='Lord Sainsbury of Turville&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06064"&gt;My right honourable friend the Deputy Minister for Women and Equality (Jacqui Smith) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06065"&gt;The Minister for the Cabinet Office (the Member for South Shields) and I are today announcing a review of the persistent social, economic and cultural factors that combine to deny individuals the opportunity to make the best of their abilities and contribute to society fully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06066"&gt;The Equalities Review, which will report to the Prime Minister by the summer of 2006, will look at barriers to opportunity and will make practical recommendations on key policy priorities for the Government and public sector, employers and trades unions, civic society and the voluntary sector. Its findings will inform the modernisation of equality legislation and the development of the new Commission for Equality and Human Rights (CEHR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06067"&gt;In the Queen&apos;s Speech, the Government announced that they intend to bring forward a Bill to establish the CEHR as soon as parliamentary time allows. The CEHR will bring together existing expertise from the current equality commissions on gender, disability and race and make provision for the new equality strands on sexual orientation, religion and belief and age, as well as promoting human rights. The Bill will also introduce provisions to outlaw discrimination on grounds of religion or belief in the provision of goods, facilities, services and public functions; and a general framework to introduce a duty on public bodies to promote equality of opportunity between women and&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 4&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;men and prohibit sex discrimination in the exercise of public functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06068"&gt;It is widely recognised that in many cases the root causes of disadvantage go beyond discrimination and cannot therefore be rectified by anti-discrimination legislation alone. Earlier consultation on the CEHR also demonstrated considerable support for modernising equality legislation and creating a simpler, fairer, legal framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06069"&gt;In response to this and in conjunction with the equalities review, the Government will also now begin a review of discrimination legislation. led by the Department of Trade and Industry, which will benefit from the background and analysis that will be provided by the equalities review. This will assess how the equality legislative framework can be modernised to fit the needs of Britain in the 21st century. Specifically, proposals will aim to minimise the burdens on business and on public services while leading to demonstrably better outcomes for minority groups. This work will be the foundation for the development of a clearer and more streamlined legislative framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06070"&gt;The Prime Minister has asked Trevor Phillips to chair the equalities review in a personal capacity. He will be joined by a small panel of leaders from the fields of business, the public sector and the social policy arena. The review panel will draw advice from a reference group co-chaired by Bert Massie (chair, Disability Rights Commission) and Julie Mellor (chair, Equal Opportunities Commission) whose members will include key equality, human rights, business and trade union stakeholders and other experts. The equalities review will be supported by a Secretariat based in the Cabinet Office and will be overseen jointly by DTI and Cabinet Office Ministers.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Equalities Review' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/equalities-review'></outline>

These commitments will help us to deliver the Government&apos;s vision for families: to ensure that all children have the best start in life, respond to changing patterns of employment and give parents more choice about how to balance their work and family responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06073"&gt;The Government have already introduced a number of measures to support working families, including longer maternity leave, increases in both statutory maternity pay and maternity allowance plus extending the payment period, new paid paternity and adoption leave and the right to request flexible working for parents of young or disabled children. However we recognise that families still face challenges in balancing&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0670P0I1066"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 5&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;their work and home responsibilities. There is a continuing evolution in family life and working patterns. In most families it is no longer the case that the father works and the mother stays at home to look after the children; instead both parents work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06074"&gt;At the same time, many employers have found that greater flexibility suits their business very well, enabling them to attract and retain good quality staff, match their business needs with the needs of individuals and encourage a more committed and productive working environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06075"&gt;The measures we are proposing respond to these changes and will help us to deliver our vision for families. Through the consultation we will be asking for views on a number of commitments. We will extend statutory maternity pay, maternity allowance and statutory adoption pay from six to nine months from April 2007, towards the goal of a year&apos;s paid leave by the end of the next Parliament. Through the consultation, we will also be seeking views about how to simplify the maternity leave and pay arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06076"&gt;Improved communication between parents and employers during maternity and adoption leave is important for employers, helping them to plan their business more successfully, and for mothers who often want to keep in touch with what is going on at work. Through consultation, we are asking for views on whether we should place a new requirement on mothers to confirm their return date with their employers in advance and on increasing the period of notice that a mother must give if she wants to return earlier than originally planned. We would also like to hear suggestions about ways to improve communication between employers and employees during maternity leave and support women returning to work after time out because of caring responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06077"&gt;We want to give more choice to parents about who cares for their child during the first year of their life and so we intend to introduce a new right for mothers to transfer a proportion of their statutory maternity leave and pay or allowance to fathers or between adopters. We are seeking views on options for how much leave and pay may be transferred from the mother to the father and how best to handle the administrative effects on the employers of the mother and the father, including managing the respective absences and ensuring that adequate notice is given of intended absence and return to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06078"&gt;Evidence has suggested that the right to request flexible working is operating successfully. Through the consultation, we will look at options for extending this right to carers of adults and to parents of older children. We also want to know if there is more the Government can do to assist employers handling requests for flexible working and help employees make requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06079"&gt;The consultation will enable us to firm up the details of our commitments to ensure the practical arrangements operate as smoothly as possible for parents, carers and business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 6&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06080"&gt;Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and will be available on the DTI website at &lt;u&gt;www.dti.gov.uk/ workandfamilies.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;' title='Work and Families' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/work-and-families'></outline>

      <outline id='2623999' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Warner)&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06081"&gt;My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Public Health (Miss Johnson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06082"&gt;I have been advised by the Food Standards Agency that on 18 February the agency issued advice to consumers not to eat foods that had inadvertently been contaminated with an illegal dye, Sudan 1. This advice follows previous action by the Food Standards Agency to ensure the withdrawal of a range of products containing contaminated chilli powder since July 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06083"&gt;Sudan 1 could contribute to an increased risk of cancer and it is sensible to avoid eating any more. However, at the levels present the risk is likely to be very small and there is no risk of immediate ill-health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06084"&gt;The Food Standards Agency, at the earliest practicable date, obtained an initial list of affected products (on the evening of 17 February) and published it together with its advice to consumers on 18 February. Further updates were published on 21 and 24 February, bringing the list of affected products to 474. The agency has taken the view that waiting for a single total list would provide less protection for consumers. The agency acted with all possible speed to inform consumers which products were affected so retailers and consumers could act on this advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06085"&gt;The agency has contacted the major catering suppliers and they have withdrawn affected products and these are included in the lists on the website. More than 150 smaller companies that received contaminated products have also withdrawn products from their customers and these products will be listed on the agency website as soon as information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06086"&gt;Most of the products have now been withdrawn. Local authorities are pursuing this to ensure any remaining products are removed from sale as a matter of urgency. The agency is considering with local authorities what enforcement action may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06087"&gt;Since July 2003 all dried and crushed or ground hot chilli and hot chilli products entering the EU must have been tested for Sudan 1. The risk has been widely publicised in the UK food industry and affected products were withdrawn from sale. The Food Standards Agency and local authorities routinely test over 1,000 products a year for Sudan 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06088"&gt;Food companies have a legal obligation to remove from sale products that do not meet food safety requirements and to inform the Food Standards Agency and local authorities, and advise consumers about the withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Food Products: Sudan 1' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/food-products-sudan-1'></outline>

        <outline id='2624004' text='The Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos)&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06089"&gt;My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Written Ministerial Statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06090"&gt;The troubles have left their mark on the people of Northern Ireland and all those affected by the conflict. Almost 4000 lives were lost, each one an individual loved and mourned by family and friends. And the human cost extends beyond these victims, to their families and friends, to all those who survived their ordeals, and to the wider community which struggles still to heal the divisions that were created and became entrenched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06091"&gt;The pain of loss is still keenly felt by those who lost loved ones. The Government cannot hope to change that. But there is a sense in which we in Northern Ireland need to come to terms with what has happened over the past 35 years: to tackle the legacy in a way that respects the suffering and loss that has been experienced; but which also allows the community as a whole to build a future that is not overshadowed by the events of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06092"&gt;Last spring, the Prime Minister said that he hoped that the Government could find a way to deal with Northern Ireland&apos;s past. Since then I have been reflecting on how we might begin this process. I have visited South Africa, to see at first hand how a very different society has sought to address its own particular legacy. I have talked privately to experts and opinion formers to hear their views. And in parallel with that process the Minister for Victims, Angela Smith, has been engaged in a detailed consultation with groups representing victims and survivors of the troubles on the future shape of services to meet their needs. I have drawn a number of lessons from these experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06093"&gt;My view remains that Northern Ireland needs its own tailored approach to dealing with the past. That is not to say that we cannot learn from the experiences of other societies that have faced a difficult and turbulent period in their recent history. But any process for dealing with Northern Ireland&apos;s past will require an approach that acknowledges and respects its unique features as well as its similarities to situations elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06094"&gt;I also believe that the scope and aims of any process need to be widely understood and agreed, and must be capable of commanding support and credibility right across the community. Government have the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that an appropriate mechanism is found for dealing with the past to the satisfaction of all sections of the community. But I recognise too that, for some, the Government&apos;s role in past events is itself seen as an issue; and it is hard for some sections of the community to see us as a genuinely&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 8&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;neutral party. Neither do the Government have a monopoly on wisdom, and I recognise the major contribution that many practitioners and other bodies are already making in this field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06095"&gt;These considerations have led me to conclude that any process for dealing with the past in Northern Ireland cannot be designed in isolation, or imposed by government. There will need to be broadly-based consultation that allows individuals and groups across the community to put their views on what form any process might take. And that consultation process itself will need broad cross-community support if the ideas it generates are to be constructively received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06096"&gt;In the light of recent events, I am clear that now is not the right moment to launch such a broadly-based consultation process. And I think that we need to be realistic about what can be achieved in advance of a political settlement. But that is not to say that nothing can be done or that political considerations should forever stand in the way of meaningful progress. There are important steps that the Government can take now to address issues that are at the heart of how we can all deal with Northern Ireland&apos;s difficult legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06097"&gt;I am therefore announcing today that the Government intend to put in place a new Victims&apos; and Survivors&apos; Commissioner. I believe that this is necessary both to ensure a real focus on the needs of victims and survivors of the troubles in Northern Ireland and to ensure that their voices continue to be heard and respected. So I am publishing alongside this announcement a consultation paper on the future of victims&apos; and survivors&apos; services for those victims, which includes the Government&apos;s initial proposals for the commissioner&apos;s detailed remit. The document sets out proposals for a comprehensive approach to the provision of services, with the commissioner playing a pivotal role in ensuring effective service delivery and in promoting the interests of all those who have suffered as a result of Northern Ireland&apos;s troubled past. One of the commissioner&apos;s responsibilities will be to take forward the establishment of the Victims&apos; and Survivors&apos; Forum envisaged in the Joint Declaration to represent their views in a structured way. That consultation will continue until the end of June this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06098"&gt;For many victims and survivors, the possibility of coming to terms with what has happened in the past is made more remote because there remain significant unanswered questions, for example about the fate of their loved ones. For many families, the difficulty of not knowing certain details surrounding their loved one&apos;s death continues to be a significant issue many years on. The Government recognise that there is a need to address in a systematic way all of the unresolved deaths in Northern Ireland&apos;s recent troubled past. As I announced last September, I have been in discussions with the Chief Constable about how the groundbreaking work of the Serious Crime Review Team (SCRT) within the Police Service of Northern Ireland might be expanded to help meet this need. I hope that both we and the PSNI will soon be in a position to say more about the next steps on this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S5LV0670P0I1068"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 9&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06099"&gt;We need to consider carefully and collectively how best to deal sensitively with the needs and expectations of all sections of the community in dealing with the legacy of the past. The creation of a Victims&apos; and Survivors&apos; Commissioner is intended as a major contribution to that work. But it does not mark the end either of the process or the Government&apos;s contribution to it.&lt;/p&gt;' title="Northern Ireland: Victims' and Survivors' Commissioner" type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/northern-ireland-victims-and-survivors'></outline>

I do, however, share the Chief of the General Staff&apos;s view that the incidents depicted do not reflect typical behaviour and standards of the British Army. We also agree that it is right to apologise on behalf of the Army to the victims and the people of Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06105"&gt;On Friday the Chief of the General Staff issued a statement on this and future cases. He explained that this was the first in a possible five cases which might come to court where the allegation against members of the British Army is that they committed acts of deliberate abuse against Iraqis.

We will publish the findings from this work when the Army is no longer constrained by the legal processes. I fully support this statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 10&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06107"&gt;The Army sets high standards and demands that they are met. The recent courts martial have demonstrated that those who fail to meet those standards are called to account.

        <outline id='2624010' text='Lord Bach&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06108"&gt;My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Geoffrey Hoon) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06109"&gt;I am pleased to report to the House the latest developments in our plans to provide the Royal Air Force with a modern replacement air refuelling capability. Last year I reported our decision to take forward single bidder negotiations with AirTanker Ltd for the provision of the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft programme which is planned to replace the RAF&apos;s fleet of VCIO and TriStar aircraft. Today I can report that significant progress has been made in those negotiations and that AirTanker has been selected as the preferred bidder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06110"&gt;We continue to believe that the provision of the capability through a service-based contract with industry under the private finance initiative (PFI) offers the best prospect of a value for money solution that fully meets the needs of our Armed Forces. Through a PFI contract, industry would own and maintain the aircraft and provide training services, infrastructure and some personnel, while the RAF would undertake military operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06111"&gt;The negotiations over the last 12 months have resulted in agreement on key commercial terms such as pricing structure, measurement of service performance, commercial use of the aircraft and the compensation that would be paid in the very unlikely event that the contract is terminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06112"&gt;This programme will present UK industry with important opportunities. I expect that several hundreds of jobs will be created to support this programme throughout the United Kingdom. Several thousand skilled UK individuals will undertake work in support of the service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06113"&gt;We will now continue to take forward negotiations with AirTanker Ltd, aimed at agreeing the detail of the complete PFI contract as soon as possible. I should stress that this remains a complex and challenging F&apos;FI programme and that issues remain to be resolved before a value for money arrangement can be concluded. At &amp;#x00A3;13 billion, it is the largest to be considered by the MOD to date. A final decision on whether or not to proceed with a PFI contract will not be taken until all negotiations, including an assessment of the finance ability of the deal, have been satisfactorily concluded. I will of course ensure that the House is kept fully in touch with significant developments.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/future-strategic-tanker-aircraft'></outline>

In the light of those reports, I am no longer planning to bring forward a draft regulatory reform order to reform marriage law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06118"&gt;This Government remain committed to the modernisation of the registration service in England and Wales. This service, with its roots in the 19th century, touches everyone during their lives and it is important that it reflects the needs of society, families and individuals. Modernisation will provide more choice for the public in how they deal with the service, improved service delivery and easier public interaction with government on a wider range of services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06119"&gt;I am actively looking for ways of delivering the key elements of civil registration modernisation and will be working with stakeholders over the coming months to agree a way forward.

It is the result of substantial consultation over the past year with the UK public, NGOs, the World Bank and other donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06123"&gt;The UK Government believe that an effective aid partnership is based on shared commitment to poverty reduction, human rights and strong financial management. The policy outlines four changes in our approach to conditionality:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06124"&gt;Developing Country Ownership&amp;#x2014;the UK will use aid to support developing countries&apos; own poverty reduction plans&amp;#x2014;based on solid evidence and wide consultation, and taking account of the views and concerns of poor people. We will not use conditions to influence the policy choices made by partner countries. We will instead agree benchmarks with partners to assess progress in reducing poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06125"&gt;Predictability&amp;#x2014;developing countries can use aid most effectively if they can rely on it as part of their long-term budget plans; for example, to recruit more teachers and health workers, or to put more people on anti-retroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS. The UK will move to long-term aid commitments, and will seek to make aid more predictable by being clear in advance about how much aid will be given and the basis on which funds will be reduced or interrupted; for example, if countries move away from agreed poverty reduction programmes, abuse human rights or misuse the funds through corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06126"&gt;Accountability&amp;#x2014;this changed approach to aid, with transparently agreed benchmarks rather than conditions imposed by donors, means that developing countries and donors will be accountable to each other, and to their own citizens, for their contribution to the shared effort on poverty reduction. The UK aims to increase transparency around the conditions and the decision-making process relating to aid. We will publish our conditions on the DfID website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06127"&gt;Harmonisation&amp;#x2014;the UK will press the World Bank and the IMF to monitor and streamline their combined terms and conditions, and will work with donors to limit the overall burden of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06128"&gt;The "Make Poverty History" campaign is calling on donors to provide "more and better aid" to help developing countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. I see the principles in this paper as&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 14&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;central to both objectives. By supporting policy leadership in developing countries, donors will make their aid more effective. And by ensuring that aid is effectively used for reducing poverty, donors will give their own countries confidence that more aid will be worth while.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Poverty Reduction' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/poverty-reduction'></outline>

This work was also aimed at supporting Palestinian efforts to prepare for Israeli disengagement as a step towards achieving the two-state vision envisaged by the road map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06130"&gt;The London meeting was chaired by the Prime Minister. Delegations from 23 nations and institutions attended including the UN Secretary-General Koff Annan, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, EU Secretary General Solana, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, G8 foreign ministers and others from the region and beyond, along with the World Bank and IMF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06131"&gt;President Abbas outlined an ambitious but realistic plan for strengthening the Palestinian Authority&apos;s (PA&apos;s) institutions in the areas of governance, security and economic development. In the area of governance, President Abbas committed his authority to completing the programme of local elections across the West Bank and Gaza in accordance with democratic values; strengthening the public sector and civil service and building a strong and independent judiciary. On security, President Abbas committed his authority to ensuring effective security implementation consistent with the PA&apos;s national security plan, in accordance with phase I of the road map; streamlining the existing security and intelligence services; and reviving lines of communication with the Israeli security establishment. On economic development, President Abbas, committed his authority to working to ensure the financial management of the PA is of the highest international standard; implementing a Unified Pensions Law; and stimulating private sector investment as the essential precondition for long-term economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06132"&gt;In response to these plans, the international community committed itself to providing financial and political support. On governance, the international community committed itself to support the programme of elections and the strengthening of the public administration and judiciary. In order to take these commitments forward, the European Commission agreed to develop and implement a short-term strategy for action on governance, supporting progress by the Palestinian Authority and ensuring engagement of the international community. The World Bank agreed to lead efforts to enhance the international community&apos;s assistance for economic preparation for Israeli disengagement. This includes exploring opportunities to promote increased private sector investment in the West Bank and Gaza. The participants asked the chair of the AHLC, the World Bank and the European&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0670P0I1071"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 15&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;Commission to develop plans to streamline the international effort and enable the international community to respond more flexibly to Palestinian needs, and to present these to the quartet, as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06133"&gt;On security, the international community committed itself to providing financial support to re-equip the security services; establishing a fund for early retirement of security personnel; and helping to address the cost of pensions for security officers. The US agreed to form a co-ordinating group to provide significant practical support to the Palestinians in the area of security to fulfil the objective set out by the quartet in May 2004 to establish a US-led oversight committee on security. US security co-ordinator General Ward would play a leading role. The security group will work closely with the PA to oversee the restructuring and retraining of the Palestinian security services. In doing so, it will help the PA fulfil all of its security-related obligations under phase I of the road map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06134"&gt;On economic development, the international community committed itself to providing expertise and financial support for the PA&apos;s economic programme. It also offered assistance for activities related to Israeli disengagement and economic revival including working with Israel and the PA to develop a reliable link between the West Bank and Gaza and to dismantle the closure regime and increase freedom of movement. The international community agreed to hold a consultative group meeting of international donors later in the year to consider an increase in funding to the PA and to establish a mechanism under World Bank leadership to encourage increased international private sector investment into the Palestinian economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06135"&gt;The participants recognised that the implementation of the commitments made by the Palestinian Authority at the London meeting would constitute a major step in implementing its road map commitments. At the same time participants urged and expected action by Israel in relation to its own road map commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06136"&gt;The participants at the London meeting also condemned the terrorist bombing in Tel Aviv on 25 February and stressed that such acts must not be allowed to derail the peace process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06137"&gt;The conclusions of the London meeting are being placed in the Library of the House.

I believe this represents a positive move forward for civil legal aid that we can build on in future years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06142"&gt;Following the consultation. I confirm that we will not be making reductions in financial eligibility except the aligning of levels described below or reducing the scope of services covered, save for minor amendments to the personal injury exclusion. We will also remove cost protection in family cases to deter unreasonable conduct by publicly funded clients, and introduce stricter controls over multiple and repeat applications in private law family cases. These controls will be enforced through improvements to processing systems that provide a reliable means of identifying previous legal aid applicants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06143"&gt;The consultation paper proposed significant changes to the funding of cases concerning financial provision in divorce (ancillary relief), including a power for the LSC to refuse legal aid for legal representation if private funding, by means of a loan or otherwise, is available and affordable in an individual case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06144"&gt;In principle, we believe that such a power would be appropriate, but we will only introduce it if satisfied that a good range of private funding arrangements is accessible to clients currently within legal aid eligibility limits. We will undertake further work on the availability and conditions of finance, in conjunction with our key stakeholders. I should emphasise that any new funding arrangements along these lines would apply only to those cases that do not reach any resolution during the financial dispute resolution hearing, but continue to full contested court proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06145"&gt;To discourage unnecessary litigation, in clinical negligence cases and actions against the police most applicants will be expected to pursue any available complaints system before they are funded to take proceedings. This will give the potential defendant public body the opportunity to respond to the matters raised and provide an explanation or apology if appropriate before it is decided whether litigation is the appropriate remedy for the client. The LSC will consult further on when such an approach would not be appropriate and on guidance to further encourage the use of mediation in non-family disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S5LV0670P0I1072"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 17&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06146"&gt;As urged by many respondents, we will also be improving the operation of the statutory charge, to encourage early repayment of legal aid costs. Our reforms package includes increasing the interest rates as an incentive to pay off the charge as soon as practicable. We also intend to introduce a discretion for the LSC to be able to decide whether the statutory charge should be postponed, subject to assessing the client&apos;s means. This will also include the power to review postponed charges at regular intervals. The LSC will also adopt a firmer approach when deciding whether a charge can be transferred to a new property. Finally, we propose to remove the exemption for the first &amp;#x00A3;3,000 of money or value from property recovered, from the statutory charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06147"&gt;We propose to strengthen the cost/benefit criterion when assessing applications for funding in claims against the police to ensure that the benefits obtained from a case are proportionate to the costs involved, and to improve general handling of police cases. We will also raise the minimum cost benefit requirements for clinical negligence damages claims to match those for other categories of case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06148"&gt;We will also be restricting the very high cost civil cases budget to ensure that disproportionately expensive cases do not preclude access to justice for smaller cases. In terms of the overall legal aid budget, the need to achieve substantial savings remains. If the Community Legal Service does not remain in budget, there is a very real risk that funding will have to be reduced in future, and consequently that the most deserving cases may not receive the assistance they need. With a limited budget, we need to ensure that legal aid funding is targeted on the most needy cases and to the priority areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06149"&gt;These proposals are fully consistent with the Fundamental Legal Aid Review (FEAR) and represent the first phase of a co-ordinated continuing legal aid reform programme to achieve an appropriate long-term settlement for legal aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06150"&gt;We propose to implement the eligibility changes in April and the remaining changes in July. A copy of the consultation response paper and the final regulatory and equalities impact assessment will be available shortly on the DCA website at &lt;u&gt;www.dca.gov.uk.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;' title='Civil Legal Aid' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/civil-legal-aid'></outline>

We have reviewed the consultation drafts and the implementation timetable in great detail in the light of the comments received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06165"&gt;We will be laying all the core sets of regulations to implement the adoption and special guardianship provisions in the next few weeks, starting today with the Adoption Agencies Regulations, the Adoptions with a Foreign Element Regulations and two statutory instruments which are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. These are the Suitability Regulations and the Restriction on the Preparation of Adoption Reports Regulations. The regulations covering access to information, adoption support&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0670P0I1073"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 19&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;services and special guardianship will follow this month. The court rules are being considered by the Family Procedure Rule Committee and will be in place and available to support training well in advance of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06166"&gt;We planned for the legislation to come fully into force in September 2005. However, following concerns expressed by those who will be required to put these important changes for children and their families into effect about the need to allow sufficient time for training and preparation once the regulations, court rules and guidance are in place, we now intend to bring the legislation fully into force on 30 December 2005. This will allow a nine-month preparation period for the field from the laying of the core regulations and&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 20&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;will enable training to take place in the autumn, after the summer holidays and immediately prior to implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06167"&gt;We remain committed to providing an extensive communication and training programme to ensure that those working in the adoption field and more widely in children&apos;s services are fully up to speed with the new legislation.

The primary legislation leaves some matters&amp;#x2014;the operative date for valuations, and the rates of return which apply for purposes of the schedule&amp;#x2014;to be specified in secondary legislation. They also allow regulations to provide for assets to be valued less frequently than annually. More generally, they enable regulations to make further exemptions from the charge set out in Schedule 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06181"&gt;The Inland Revenue issued a consultative document on 18 August 2004 &lt;i&gt;Taxation of Pre-Owned Assets: Further Consultation&lt;/i&gt; seeking views on the matters to be covered by regulations. There was a full and constructive response and I am grateful to all who took part. We propose to make regulations as follows, having regard to the responses received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06182"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Valuation date&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06183"&gt;As proposed in our consultation document, the valuation date for a tax year will be 6 April in the year or, if later, the beginning of the "taxable period" for which the asset in question first becomes chargeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06184"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The "prescribed rate"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06185"&gt;The "prescribed rate" (to be applied to the values of chattels and intangible assets when quantifying the cash value of the benefit enjoyed) will be equal to the "official rate" of interest, as defined in Section 181 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003. The rate is currently 5 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06186"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Valuations at extended intervals&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06187"&gt;Regulations will provide, broadly, that land and chattels will be valued every five years. That is to say, a valuation will be made as prescribed in the primary legislation for the first tax year in which a particular asset becomes chargeable under Schedule 15. That valuation will also be used in any of the four succeeding years in which a charge arises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06188"&gt;If a charge arises in the fifth year after the first chargeable year, a fresh valuation will be made which will apply in the next four succeeding years, and so on for years 10, 15 and subsequent five-year anniversaries. If no charge arises for the fifth year, or any later five-year anniversary, no valuation need be&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 24&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;made until the next tax year (if any) for which a charge arises, and a fresh series of five-yearly valuations will start from that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06189"&gt;Valuations will be carried forward in cash terms without adjustment (e.g. for indexation against asset price inflation, as the enabling power would permit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06190"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Equity release&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06191"&gt;Schedule 15 provides exemption for any case where the former owner continues to enjoy an asset they have sold, so long as they have disposed of their whole interest in it (apart from the right of continuing enjoyment) and have done so either at arm&apos;s length or on arm&apos;s length terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06192"&gt;It became clear in consultation that this was not sufficient to accommodate all open-market equity release transactions, under which homeowners often sell only a part share in their property. I made clear last autumn that regulations under Schedule 15 would cover the full range of &lt;i&gt;bona fide&lt;/i&gt; equity-release schemes with arm&apos;s length providers, while continuing to bear down on schemes aimed at avoidance. With that in mind, we do not in general think it is appropriate to provide exemption for sales of a part interest which are made otherwise than at arm&apos;s length. If one member of a family needs to raise cash and another member of the family is willing and able to provide it, there are other and more straightforward ways of structuring this than adopting the form of an equity release transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06193"&gt;The point was, however, made in consultation that some intra-family part disposals can arise from patterns of behaviour adopted for good family or business reasons: for example, where a child moves in to care for an aged parent and acquires an equitable interest in their shared home as a corollary of that, or where younger members of a family take over the active role in a family partnership, and in doing so acquire an interest from the partners who preceded them. We also accept that any cases where asset owners have already sold a part interest within their family are unlikely, given the law as it stood at the time, to have chosen that approach primarily for tax avoidance purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06194"&gt;Bringing together these different considerations, the regulations will extend the existing exemption (described above) to all sales done at arm&apos;s length where they involve the whole or a part of the vendor&apos;s interest in their asset. They will extend this exemption to any part sale, even if not at arm&apos;s length, so long as it was made before today and on arm&apos;s length terms. This will also apply to future disposals if they are made for a consideration other than money or readily realisable assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06195"&gt;Regulations to this effect will be made shortly, in time to take effect from the commencement of the new charge on 6 April. The Inland Revenue will also be publishing its guidance on the interpretation and operation of Schedule 15, it will be announced and made available at &lt;u&gt;www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;' title='Finance Act 2004: Pre-owned Asset Regulations' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/finance-act-2004-pre-owned-asset'></outline>

The objective of the directive as amended is to increase the transparency of funding given by government and other public sector bodies to other bodies operating in the market place and which may be in receipt of state aid. The directive&apos;s provisions will improve the Commission&apos;s ability to investigate potentially illegal state aid, including allegations of over-compensation for performing a public service obligation or the cross-subsidisation of public funds into other commercial activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06198"&gt;A key objective of the consultation exercise is to gather information on which organisations are likely to be caught by the directive and whether and to what extent there may already be provisions in place that would meet the requirements of the directive, so that we can best judge how to implement it. However, the department&apos;s initial conclusion is that legislation may well be necessary to ensure full implementation of the directive. The consultation document therefore also seeks views on draft regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 26&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06199"&gt;It is estimated that the directive will affect less than 0.5 per cent of UK businesses i.e. approximately 8,000 businesses out of a total of about 1.6 million, since it does not apply to entities with an annual turnover below &lt;ob/&gt;40 million, i.e. approximately &amp;#x00A3;27.5 million (as at 02/03/05).

If the taxpayer dies within the next few years after making the election there is a possibility of two IHT charges on the same underlying asset value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06218"&gt;In particular, many taxpayers have used a "double trust" structure; one trust is created to buy the settlor&apos;s asset in exchange for an IOU, and this IOU is gifted into a second trust to take it out of the settlor&apos;s taxable estate. If the settlor dies within seven years, the estate will be liable to IHT on the IOU; and if they have made an election under Schedule 15 to the Finance Act 2004, their estate will be also liable on the underlying asset. It is clear from responses in consultation that this prospect is preventing some people making an election which they would otherwise find attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06219"&gt;The regulations will eliminate this double IHT charge so that people who wish to make an election under Schedule 15 can be assured that only one IHT charge will be due whatever the timing of their death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06220"&gt;The regulations will be announced and made available on the Inland Revenue&apos;s website at &lt;u&gt;www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;' title='Finance Act 2004: Pre-owned Asset Regulations' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/finance-act-2004-pre-owned-asset-1'></outline>

The antecedent components of the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment (RGBW) were to merge with, in the case of the Gloucestershire element, the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment (which would also transfer to the Light Infantry) and, in the case of the Duke of Edinburgh&apos;s Royal Regiment element, the Princess of Wales&apos;s Royal Regiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06232"&gt;However, following my announcement, there was a widespread perception that the plan to split the RGBW along the lines of its antecedent parts amounted to the disbandment of the RGBW and the abandonment of its own heritage. In view of this, I asked the Executive Committee of the Army Board (ECAB) to review its original recommendation in relation to the future of the RGBW. In the process of this review, ECAB noted that in formulating its original recommendation on the RGBW it had given insufficient weight to the sense of identity that has evolved during the 10 years since the RGBW was created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06233"&gt;ECAB concluded that although the substance of the original recommendation&amp;#x2014;that the RGBW will form the basis of the reduction by one battalion of the Prince of Wales&apos;s Division&amp;#x2014;should not change, more could be done to preserve the identity and heritage of the RGBW itself, and not just of its antecedents. ECAB now recommends that this should be achieved instead through an amalgamation of the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment with the RGBW. The resulting new regiment will become 1st Battalion the Light Infantry (reflecting the original decision for the D and D to join the Light Infantry).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06234"&gt;I have accepted the need for this adjustment to the original recommendation.

The plan is a framework for action to accelerate all our efforts over the coming year and sets out counter-narcotics (CN) activities ahead under eight pillars:&lt;ul&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;building institutions&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;information campaign&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;alternative livelihoods&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;interdiction and law enforcement&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;criminal justice&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;eradication&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;demand reduction and treatment of addicts&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;regional co-operation.&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06252"&gt;The adoption of this plan follows the successful holding by President Karzai in December 2004 of the first counter-narcotics national conference in Afghanistan. At that conference and since then, President Karzai has delivered powerful messages to reinforce his strong determination to act against all aspects of the narcotics trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06253"&gt;The UK welcomes this renewed commitment and joins with the wider international community in pledging our collective, increased support for the 2005 plan. There are some early signs that this year may see an overall reduction in opium poppy cultivation levels. However, as it is still early in the harvest cycle, we need to wait for the UN assessments later in the year on levels of cultivation and on how much of the crop in the fields has been destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06254"&gt;The UK has increased its spending to &amp;#x0024;100 million this year on counter-narcotics activities in Afghanistan. Specifically, we are stepping up activity in support of the 2005 plan in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06255"&gt;&lt;i&gt;On creating alternative livelihoods for farmers who currently grow opium poppy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06256"&gt;Following the visit of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0670P0I1082"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 37&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;to Afghanistan in January 2005, the UK has pledged &amp;#x0024;125 million of support for alternative livelihoods in 2005&amp;#x2013;06; our alternative livelihoods commitment has more than doubled annually from 2002&amp;#x2013;03 to 2005&amp;#x2013;06. The UK is also leading the way in pressing some of the larger multilateral donors, such as the World Bank, to include counter-narcotics objectives in their programmes. Activities include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06257"&gt;substantial support to activities to bring short term, visible impact in 2005, building on the &amp;#x0024;5 million already made available for "cash for work";&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06258"&gt;support to a wide range of agricultural and off-farm income-generating activities in poppy-growing provinces;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06259"&gt;increasing access to credit to rural areas, and developing products to address the specific problem of opium debt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06260"&gt;assessing opportunities to promote alternative products to opium poppy, and more favourable terms of trade for those products; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06261"&gt;improving the co-ordination and implementation of development and counter-narcotics programmes in Badakhshan, where the UK has already committed more than &amp;#x0024;7.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06262"&gt;&lt;i&gt;On law enforcement&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06263"&gt;The UK has mapped out and is co-ordinating the development of the Counter-narcotics Police of Afghanistan (CNPA), working with other lead nations to establish the counter-narcotics capacity of all Afghan law enforcement institutions. As part of the CNPA development plan, the UK is establishing a further nine mobile detection teams (over 100 officers) in the next 18 months, capable of interdicting drug traffickers in Kabul and the provinces. We are also providing mentoring for intelligence and investigation units. We are looking to international donors to contribute to the CNPA development plan. We also welcome the recent results of the Afghan Special Narcotics Force (ASNF), for which the UK has provided advice and funding. The force has seized over 75 tonnes of opiates, destroyed 80 drugs labs and disrupted two drugs bazaars during the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06264"&gt;&lt;i&gt;On developing the criminal justice system&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06265"&gt;The UK. working with the UN, has set up and completed the first phase of training and mentoring of the Counter-narcotics Criminal Justice Task Force of investigators, prosecutors and judges. The task force will be 80 strong by mid-2005. We have also funded UNODC (nearly &amp;#x0024;2 million) to establish a secure court and prison facility for counter-narcotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06266"&gt;&lt;i&gt;On eradication of the opium crop&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06267"&gt;This will be carried out in 2005 by the US-supported Central Poppy Eradication Force (CPEF) and by governors and police chiefs at local level. The UK is working closely in both these areas and has established a planning and monitoring cell to ensure that eradication by CPEF is targeted in a way which takes account of alternative livelihoods. We are also helping CPEF with salaries and equipment and are the major&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 38&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;donor for verification and assessment of the eradication campaign to ensure it is carried out: over &amp;#x0024;1 million to establish 30 ground-based verification teams (240 people) and satellite imagery. The first 15 verification teams should produce preliminary results by March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06268"&gt;&lt;i&gt;On building the institutions necessary to support long-term Afghan commitment&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06269"&gt;The UK is helping to build central and provincial capacity in a number of key government institutions, including the new Counter-narcotics (CN) Ministry under Minister Qaderi, the counter-narcotics function within the Ministry of the Interior, the Rural Reconstruction Ministry, the Office of the National Security Adviser, the Civil Service Commission and the Cabinet Secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06270"&gt;&lt;i&gt;On lobbying&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06271"&gt;My right honourable friends the Foreign Secretary and the development Secretary have now launched a substantial lobbying campaign to encourage international partners, including the G8, the EU, the US, neighbouring countries of Afghanistan and other Berlin conference participants, to support the plan and help establish the new Counter-narcotics Trust Fund. The aim of this fund will be to pull together donor support for the Afghan Government&apos;s counter-narcotics priorities. The April 2005 Afghan Development Forum will be an important opportunity for the Afghan Government to seek additional support for alternative livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06272"&gt;The UK is also working with Afghan and international partners:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06273"&gt;to raise public awareness of the risks to Afghanistan of the drugs trade and the dangers to health from addiction associated with growing opium poppy through proactive and comprehensive information campaigns and drug treatment activities; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06274"&gt;to increase regional co-operation to tackle the drugs trade across borders through implementation of the April 2004 Berlin Declaration on Counter-narcotics within the framework of the Kabul Good Neighbourly Relations Declaration of December 2002. In 2004&amp;#x2013;05, the UK provided around &amp;#x0024;2.5 million of assistance to increase counter-narcotics capacity on Afghanistan&apos;s borders with Iran, Pakistan and Tajikistan, the three main routes for opiates being smuggled out of Afghanistan. Further such assistance is planned for financial year 2005&amp;#x2013;06.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06275"&gt;My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (Mr Jack Straw) visited Kabul on 16 February, the day President Karzai launched the 2005 CN implementation plan. They agreed on the crucial importance of working together in support of the plan to mobilise international assistance so that narcotics do not destroy Afghanistan&apos;s potential for stability, reconstruction and a thriving licit economy. The 2005 plan therefore represents an important opportunity. We share the resolve of the Afghan Government to achieve the sustainable elimination of opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan in 2005 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S5LV0670P0I1083"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 39&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06276"&gt;Copies of the plan are being placed in the Library of the House.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Afghanistan: Counter-narcotics' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/afghanistan-counter-narcotics'></outline>

These Answers referred to conventional forces and remain true with respect to them. It has been drawn to Ministers&apos; attention, however, that UK Special Forces from time to time used hooding as a temporary measure for the safe arrest and transit of detained persons until May 2004. For the sake of completeness the parliamentary record should be corrected to reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06283"&gt;Most of the criticism about the use of hooding has related to the obscuring of vision during interrogation. This practice is contrary to the instructions given by the then Prime Minister in 1972 and was ceased by UK military interrogators thereafter. UK military interrogators are made fully aware of this as part of&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 40&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;their training and there have been no reported incidents where UK military interrogators have interrogated individuals while they have been hooded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06284"&gt;Our legal advice remains that the practice of temporarily obscuring the vision of a detained person, for the purposes of initial detention and transit, by the use of a hood is not contrary to the law. In Iraq, the initial circumstances on the ground were such that it was judged by certain military commanders that its use was appropriate given the numbers of detainees and in some cases the need to obscure the identities of particular detainees for their own protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06285"&gt;I can, however, confirm that no UK forces are currently authorised to use hooding in any circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Iraq: Interrogation Techniques' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/iraq-interrogation-techniques'></outline>

On 25 November 2004, following a period of trades union consultation, I announced the implementation of changes arising from the recommendations of the end-to-end review of the logistics process for military aircraft support. I indicated that, in addition to changes arising from air depth support, the application of end-to-end logistic principles would result in a reduction of around 1,500 RAF uniformed personnel and some reductions in MOD civilian posts at some RAF stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06288"&gt;As part of this continuing process, I am announcing today how the overall reductions in both RAF uniformed personnel and MOD civilians as a result of the application of the end-to-end logistic principles are expected to affect individual RAF stations. The civilian reductions will be subject to TU consultation. These efficiency reductions, together with the increase to the defence budget, will ensure that the department can modernise its Armed Forces to meet tomorrow&apos;s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06289"&gt;Further work to identify efficiencies has now estimated that the reduction in the number of RAF uniformed personnel posts will be in the region of 2,000. With regard to MOD civilian posts, I anticipate that a net additional 70 posts will no longer be required. These changes will form part of the service and civilian manpower reductions of 7,500 and 10,000 respectively that were announced on 21 July last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06290"&gt;The effect on individual stations of these efficiencies are detailed in the table below.

These blocks are located in the strategic environmental assessment (SEA) areas 1&amp;#x2013;5 (a map of the SEA areas can be found on the website indicated below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06305"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Strategic Environmental Assessment ( SEA )&amp;#x2014;Post Adoption Procedures&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06306"&gt;The DTI&apos;s draft plan to offer licences for offshore oil and gas exploration and production through a 23rd licensing round was the subject of a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) initiated in 2003. The SEA is documented on a dedicated website &lt;u&gt;(www.offshore-sea.org.uk)&lt;/u&gt; I and includes commissioned reports on various components of the natural environment, cultural features and socio-economic considerations. In addition, as part of the SEA new information was collected, for example, on selected seabed features through sea-floor mapping, sampling and photography, and on the offshore behaviour of seals by means of satellite tagging. The draft plan for the 23rd licensing round included offering blocks within the area&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0670P0I1085"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 43&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;to the east of Scotland, and also in those areas that had been subject to earlier DTI SEAs (SEAs 1, 2, 3, and 4) which covered the remaining parts of the UK North Sea exclusive economic zone and the UK EEZ to the north and west of Orkney and Shetland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06307"&gt;The potential implications of the exploration and production activities which could follow if the draft plan was adopted were considered at an expert assessment workshop and a stakeholder workshop. The results of these workshops were assessed further and documented in an environmental report which then formed the basis for consultation with the consultation bodies and the public. The initiation of a three month consultation period on the DTI&apos;s draft plan and environmental report was advertised in a number of local and national newspapers and by e-mail notification to a wide range of individuals and organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06308"&gt;All responses received from statutory and other consultees on the draft plan and the environmental report have been considered by the DTI and a post-consultation report for SEA 5 has been prepared and placed on the SEA website. This summarises consultee comments and DTI responses to them. The full texts of consultee comments have also been placed on the SEA website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06309"&gt;In deciding to proceed with a 23rd offshore licensing round the DTI has considered the conclusions and recommendations of the SEA 5 environmental report together with feedback received from consultees. As a result of the SEA process, a number of blocks are being withheld from licensing for the present on environmental grounds. These blocks are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06310"&gt;15/20c, 15/25d, 34/6, 34/7, 34/8, 34/12, 34/13, 34/17, 34/18, 40/15, 41/29, 41/30, 47/11, 47/27, 47/28, 47/29, 47/30, 48/26, 51/3, 51/4, 51/5, 52/1, 52/28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06311"&gt;Licensing of these blocks may be revisited in the future; for example, as more information on the features of interest becomes available. In addition, a number of blocks may be licensed but with conditions attached restricting or prohibiting marine activities. It should be noted that the Offshore Petroleum Production and Pipe-lines (Assessment of Environmental Effects) Regulations 1999 and the Offshore Petroleum Activities (Conservation of Habitats) Regulations 2001 variously require that all major activities undertaken in connection with UK offshore hydrocarbon exploration and production include environmental assessment as part of consenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06312"&gt;In addition, 34 blocks will not be offered for licensing in these SEA areas at the request of the Ministry of Defence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06313"&gt;The DTI has established an offshore oil and gas environmental monitoring committee which is charged with co-ordinating the monitoring of significant environmental effects of the industry, including those that could arise from the implementation of the plan to hold a 23rd round of offshore licensing. The results of this monitoring will be made publicly available, including through the SEA website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 44&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06314"&gt;In addition to the website above, a copy of the SEA report can be reviewed free of charge at:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06315"&gt;Department of Trade and Industry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06316"&gt;1 Victoria Street&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06317"&gt;London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06318"&gt;SW1H 0ET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06319"&gt;Arrangements to view the report can be made by telephoning 020 7215 5032.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Oil and Gas: Licensing' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/oil-and-gas-licensing'></outline>

The Commission has formally published two of the proposals. These are a directive amending the fourth and seventh accounting directives and a directive amending the second Company Law Directive on Capital Maintenance. The Commission is expected to publish the third proposal shortly, a directive on the cross-border transfer of the registered office of a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06323"&gt;By covering all three proposals in one single consultation we hope to give stakeholders the opportunity not only to consider all proposals at the same time but also to understand how they relate to the overall framework of modernising company law and corporate governance in the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06324"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Amendments to the Fourth and Seventh Accounting Directives&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06325"&gt;This proposal seeks to enhance confidence in financial statements and annual accounts published by European companies. It would introduce an annual corporate governance statement for publicly traded companies, tighten up accounting disclosure requirements and clarify the collective responsibility of directors towards the company for the annual report and accounts. The Government support the broad principles behind the directive and believe that light touch common standards for disclosure should contribute to EU market confidence, encourage cross-border investment and facilitate cross-border access to capital. They are of the view that the requirements of the directive are broadly consistent with existing UK law and practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06326"&gt;The consultation seeks views on the extent to which the proposed disclosure requirements will place additional burdens on companies and whether they&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0670P0I1086"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 45&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;will be of value to users of company accounts. It also asks for views on the nature of the information the Commission is proposing to be contained in the corporate governance statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06327"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Amendments to the Second Company Law Directive ( Capital Maintenance)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06328"&gt;This proposal seeks to simplify the second Company Law Directive so that it is easier for public limited liability companies to take measures affecting the size, structure and ownership of their capital. It contains provisions to simplify procedures for valuation of non-cash consideration for allocation of shares, acquisition of own shares, financial assistance and waiving of pre-emption rights. It also aims to enhance standardised creditor protection for reductions of capital and introduces "squeeze-out" and "sell-out" rights of majority and minority shareholders respectively. The Government support the objective of streamlining measures to reduce burdens for business behind this proposal but have reservations about the real deregulatory benefits it will bring in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06329"&gt;The consultation seeks views on a number of issues to determine whether the changes in the proposal will have a significant beneficial impact for companies wanting to change their capital structures. It raises a number of areas where the proposals could lead to uncertainty on whether and how certain provisions will apply. It also seeks views on the proposed introduction of "squeeze-out" and "sell-out" rights in situations other than takeovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06330"&gt;Additionally, later this year the Commission intends to start a study to look at more radical reform of the capital maintenance regime and the Government invite views on the overall merits of reform of this nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06331"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Proposal far a Directive on the Cross-Border Transfer of Registered Office&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06332"&gt;This proposal will establish a legal framework for companies registered in the EU to transfer their registered office from one member state to another without having to be wound up. In Great Britain both public and private companies registered under the Companies Act 1985 would be able to utilise the proposed transfer structure. The Government support the measure as one which should extend the opportunities for corporate restructuring across the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06333"&gt;This consultation is based on the proposals contained in the Commission&apos;s e-consultation carried out in spring 2004. It explores whether the overall proposal will be useful to UK companies and seeks views on the details of the procedures to be followed.&lt;/p&gt;' title='EU: Corporate Governance' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/eu-corporate-governance'></outline>

        <outline id='2624059' text='Lord Warner&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06358"&gt;My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Community (Dr Ladyman) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06359"&gt;In February 2001, my right honourable friend the then Secretary of State for Health (Mr Alan Milburn) announced that the department would be developing a new national service framework (NSF) with a particular focus on the needs of people with neurological conditions. I am pleased to announce that the long-term conditions NSF is today being published. It is an integral part of this Government&apos;s overall strategy to improve services for people with long-term conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06360"&gt;This NSF covers the full range of issues for people with neurological conditions across health and social care. It has been developed through active consultation with key stakeholders, including people who use services and their carers, and the direct participation of experts and practitioners from the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06361"&gt;Although the NSF focuses on people with neurological conditions, much of the guidance it offers can apply to anyone living with a non-neurological long-term condition. Commissioners will therefore be encouraged to use the NSF in planning service&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 48&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;developments for people with other long-term conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06362"&gt;The long-term conditions NSF is an evidence-based, 10-year strategy, which advocates a cultural shift in the provision of care, with services being designed and delivered around the needs of people and their families. It highlights the need for high-quality services that offer choice and are prompt, convenient and responsive and that look at the "whole person", rather than at a presenting illness or problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06363"&gt;The broad remit of the NSF is covered in 11 quality requirements, which are:&#x000A;&lt;ul&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;A person-centred service&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Early recognition, prompt diagnosis and treatment&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Emergency and acute management&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Early and specialist rehabilitation&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Community rehabilitation and support&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Vocational rehabilitation&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Providing equipment and accommodation&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Providing personal care and support&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Palliative care&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Supporting family and carers&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;li&gt;Caring for people with neurological conditions in hospital or other health and social care settings&lt;/li&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06364"&gt;The long-term conditions NSF has been developed in line with this government&apos;s wider public sector reforms, to devolve power and responsibility to local agencies. While the NSF sets out the levels of service quality which we expect to be available by 2015, the pace of change is to be left to local National Health Service and social care discretion to determine, and will be balanced against other priorities. The costs of implementing the NSF will be met from the additional resources announced in the 2004 spending review for the NHS and adult personal social services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06365"&gt;Copies of the NSF for long-term conditions have been placed in the Library.&lt;/p&gt;' title='NHS: Long-term Conditions' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/nhs-long-term-conditions'></outline>

The report of the Joint Committee on the draft Charities Bill endorsed the self-regulation of fundraising initiative and recommended that the Government publish for consultation the criteria in accordance with which my right honourable friend the Home Secretary will judge whether self-regulation is working effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06381"&gt;Proposals for a "regulation of fundraising scheme" have recently been published by the Institute of Fundraising. The main aim of the scheme is to maintain and build on the high levels of public trust and confidence in the voluntary sector&apos;s fundraising activities. The scheme will help the sector guard against future threats to the high levels of public confidence, and to provide the sector with a platform to defend itself against criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06382"&gt;The principles in accordance with which the Government propose that the success of the "regulation of fundraising scheme" should be assessed include: measures of participation, comprising of the number of participating organisations, the proportion of fundraised income covered by scheme membership, and the range of organisations in the scheme&apos;s membership; and other measures such as the effectiveness of complaints handling, public awareness of the scheme, the promotion of best practice, the scheme&apos;s independence, effective sanctions for non-compliance, the impact of the scheme on non-members and effective liaison with other regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06383"&gt;In the scheme&apos;s initial years the focus would be on measuring the take-up of the scheme within the sector as it develops its membership.

        <outline id='2624077' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Warner)&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06400"&gt;My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S5LV0670P0I1091"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 55&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06401"&gt;We are publishing today a new concordat and moratorium on genetics and insurance, which has been agreed between the Government and the Association of British Insurers (ABI). Copies have been placed in the Library. An electronic version has been placed on the Department of Health website at www.dh.gov.uk/ publications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06402"&gt;The new framework, which comes into force today, provides that the use of genetic information by insurance companies will be transparent, fair, and subject to independent oversight. It will help to reassure patients who may be deterred from taking predictive genetic tests for fear of the insurance consequences, and is flexible enough to respond to fast-moving technological and clinical developments in genetic testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06403"&gt;The concordat balances the interest of patients and insurers. Those seeking insurance should not withhold information relevant to underwriting, and insurers should not treat people who have an adverse predictive genetic test result less favourably than others, except as provided for in the concordat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06404"&gt;The moratorium on the use by insurers of predictive genetic test results is extended for an extra five years until 1 November 2011. No one will be required to disclose the results of a predictive genetic test unless it has been approved by the Genetics and Insurance Committee (GAIC) and is for insurance of more than &amp;#x00A3;500,000 for life insurance or &amp;#x00A3;300,000 for other health insurance. This means that for the vast majority of insurance policies genetic tests results will not be used at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06405"&gt;The concordat clarifies the broad types of insurance for which predictive genetic test results may be relevant. They are life, critical illness, and income protection insurance policies. Insurers will not use the results from predictive genetic tests for travel insurance, private&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 56&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;medical insurance, or any other one-off or annual policy, or for long-term-care insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06406"&gt;The concordat also clarifies the circumstances when patients need not disclose genetic information, and how information will be handled by insurers. For example, genetic tests taken as part of a research study will not need to be disclosed to insurers. This is good news for United Kingdom clinical researchers, as it specifically rules out the use by insurers of the results of genetic tests taken during participation in clinical trials, removing a potential obstacle to patient recruitment in the development of diagnostic tests, treatments, and medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06407"&gt;These commitments are backed up by independent oversight of the use of predictive genetic tests by GAIC together with the ABI&apos;s code of practice and an impartial complaint and arbitration process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06408"&gt;The Government would like to thank the Human Genetics Commission, GAIC, patient groups including Breakthrough Breast Cancer, CancerBACUP and the Alzheimer&apos;s Society, and other research groups and individuals who have provided valuable contributions that have helped shape this new concordat and moratorium on genetics and insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06409"&gt;The new framework means that insurance will continue to be available for people who take predictive genetic tests. They will need to disclose only the adverse results of predictive genetic tests for a limited range of unusually high-value insurance polices&amp;#x2014;and then only if the predictive genetic test has been approved by the GAIC. It is the Government&apos;s view that this approach is good news for individuals and insurance companies as it will ensure that the rights, safety and well-being of those taking predictive genetic tests are protected whilst also ensuring a viable and fair insurance market.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Genetics and Insurance' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/genetics-and-insurance'></outline>

        <outline id='2624084' text='Lord Falconer of Thoroton&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06438"&gt;I am pleased to announce today plans for the introduction of a National Enforcement Service to take forward my commitment to ensuring the fullest possible compliance with court orders. For too long enforcement of court orders has been patchy and flawed. We have made real improvements in enforcement. The payment rate of fines now at 80 per cent compared to just over 50 per cent two years ago. But there is more to be done. The time has come for the next stage of reform&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06439"&gt;My proposals involve the introduction of a robust national framework to deliver a single consistent enforcement process for the whole of England and Wales, and to deal robustly with offenders who fail to attend court, default on fine payments and breach community penalty orders. The launch of the new unified Her Majesty&apos;s Court Service next month will allow us to put in place a cross-criminal justice system enforcement team that is more distinct, professional and better skilled. The specific remit of the National Enforcement Service will be to bear down on the hard core of offenders who consistently attempt to flout their obligations to the courts. This does not mean a new agency or department, but a better, more collaborative approach to tackling enforcement, which builds on the lessons learned from national initiatives including the recent "Operation Payback". Enforcement staff in the magistrates&apos; courts together with the police, the National Probation Service and other criminal justice agencies will form the core of the service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S5LV0670P0I1093"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 59&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06440"&gt;Improving sentence compliance is key to building public confidence in the criminal justice system and the National Enforcement Service will do just that.

The Department of Health has asked the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA), which is taking responsibility for confidential inquiries from April 2005, to carry out a scoping study to establish the best way to conduct the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06483"&gt;The Government&apos;s White Paper &lt;i&gt;Valuing People,&lt;/i&gt; published in 2001, included as one of its main objectives improvements in the health of people with learning disabilities. In particular, it highlighted the need to address evidence of health inequalities. The Government have taken action to address this, primarily through asking learning disability partnership boards to develop plans for health action planning in their local areas. But &lt;i&gt;Valuing People&lt;/i&gt; also noted that there was cause for concern about evidence of avoidable illness and premature deaths, and included an undertaking to look at the feasibility of establishing a confidential inquiry into mortality among people with learning disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06484"&gt;The department has held wide-ranging discussions with experts and stakeholders and has determined that an inquiry would not only be practicable but would also provide valuable information about the healthcare of people with learning disabilities. Healthcare for this group has also continued to be raised as a matter of concern for organisations such as Mencap and the Disability Rights Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06485"&gt;Professor Sir John Lilleyman (Medical Director, NPSA) is the lead director for confidential inquiries and will be in charge of the management of the scoping exercise.

The Department for International Development will press for concrete measures by both sides to affirm that they will do everything in their power to safeguard poverty reduction programmes and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06496"&gt;We are deeply concerned about human rights in Nepal and will continue to work with others in the international community to encourage democracy in Nepal, the full protection of human rights by both parties to the conflict and progress towards a peace process.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Nepal: Assistance Suspension' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/nepal-assistance-suspension'></outline>

        <outline id='2624103' text='Lord McIntosh of Haringey&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06499"&gt;My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Tessa Jowell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06500"&gt;I am publishing today the department&apos;s five-year plan, &lt;i&gt;Living Life to the Full&lt;/i&gt;. Copies will be deposited in the House Libraries and the plan will be available on the DCMS website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06501"&gt;The plan sets our course for the next five years and builds on the significant progress that we have made in recent years. It sets out our achievements, our goals and the practical steps we will take to achieve them in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06502"&gt;The fabric of this country and the quality of life we all experience are improving rapidly. The average proportion of household income spent on leisure nearly doubled between 1977 and 2002. We all expect more choice and higher quality. At the same time, opportunities are expanding to enjoy the arts, visit museums and galleries, to play sport, to travel, access the world&apos;s best media and prosper in the creative industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;image src="S5LV0670P0I1098"/&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 69&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06503"&gt;We have come a long way. In 2001 we introduced free admission to national museums and galleries&amp;#x2014;resulting in a record number of visits&amp;#x2014;34 million last year. Creative Partnerships&amp;#x2014;bringing the experience and stimulation of culture to young people in deprived areas&amp;#x2014;will see 450,000 young people involved by this time next year. We recently published the BBC Green Paper setting out the framework for a strong BBC independent of government. We are investing &amp;#x00A3;1 billion in sports facilities to benefit every community. Working in partnership with the Department for Education and Skills we have ensured that more than a half of all children in school do a weekly minimum of two hours PE and school sport, which is up from a quarter in 2002. We are putting our wholehearted support behind London&apos;s bid to bring the Olympics to this country in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06504"&gt;But there are still too many people who do not know about the opportunities available to them or who are not able to afford the cost of their talent: parents who cannot afford to support their children in making the most of their creativity and skills; adults who do not know how to get involved in local cultural and sporting opportunities; and young people who miss out on formative experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06505"&gt;In the plan we make 10 commitments covering the key areas where the department, working together with our partners in our sponsored bodies, in local government, in the voluntary and private sectors, can make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06506"&gt;We will work to build a comprehensive offer to young people on culture&amp;#x2014;known as Creative Sparks. We will review how National Lottery money has been spent so far on arts, sport, heritage and film projects, and then consult about how proceeds should be spent in these areas after 2009. We will continue to improve our support for &amp;#x00E9;lite athletes, rewarding success with the talented athlete and 2012 scholarships. We will persuade nearly half a million adults per year to become physically active. We will complete our programme to replace outdated licensing and gambling laws, balancing personal freedom and prosperity with strengthening protection for the vulnerable. We will provide a virtual high-street for tourism and leisure offering an information and booking service to on-line users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06507"&gt;The title of the plan is &lt;i&gt;Living Life to the Full&lt;/i&gt;. Quite simply that is what our sectors can offer&amp;#x2014;the ability for everyone to live their lives and develop their talents to the fullest extent. So the aim of our five year plan is straightforward, yet ambitious&amp;#x2014;making the quality of life in this country world-class and giving everyone the chance to taste it.&lt;/p&gt;' title='DCMS: Five-Year Plan' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/dcms-five-year-plan'></outline>
        <outline id='2624104' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Sainsbury of Turville)&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06508"&gt;My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06509"&gt;I am pleased to announce that we are today publishing a White Paper setting out proposals for a Company Law Reform Bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;col&gt;WS 70&lt;/col&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06510"&gt;These proposals result from a comprehensive review of company law, which we initiated in 1998. In 2001 we received the final report from the Company Law Review, an independent group of experts, practitioners and business people. The White Paper also takes account of international and other developments. We are very grateful for the input of a wide range of interested parties into the proposals we are bringing forward today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06511"&gt;The White Paper sets out a range of measures designed to further four crucial objectives: to enhance shareholder engagement and a long term investment culture; to ensure better regulation and a "think small first" approach; to make it easier to set up and run a company; and to provide flexibility for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06512"&gt;The proposals are part of a wider programme of action to facilitate enterprise, encourage investment and promote long-term company performance. We brought forward legislation to strengthen regulation of the accounting and audit profession and to allow a new type of community enterprise company. We have laid draft regulations for quoted companies to produce an operating and financial review and we have introduced greater transparency by quoted companies on directors&apos; remuneration. We have taken smaller companies out of the need for an audit. We have also worked with market participants to strengthen corporate governance and shareholder engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06513"&gt;The measures set out in the White Paper represent a significant step forward in ensuring that our law remains up to date, flexible, and accessible for all those who use it. By making company law better fitted to today&apos;s realities, the measures should create improved performance across the economy as a whole. They could also produce cost savings for business of some &amp;#x00A3;250 million a year. The proposals will help to ensure that Britain remains one of the best places in the world to set up and run a business.&lt;/p&gt;' title='Company Law Reform' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/company-law-reform'></outline>
        <outline id='2624105' text='The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Warner)&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06514"&gt;My right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Health has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06515"&gt;On 27 January I announced that the Chief Medical Officer for England had agreed to carry out a review of the revalidation of doctors and related matters, following concerns expressed by Dame Janet Smith in her fifth report from the Shipman inquiry. Dame Janet focused her inquiries, as her remit required, on the medical profession. However, if changes are proposed to the arrangements for doctors, it is likely that they will have important implications for the regulatory arrangements for the other health professions, particularly where their roles are changing. And there may be other implications. I have therefore asked Mr Andrew Foster, director of Workforce, to lead a review of non-medical professional regulation. This&#x000A;&lt;image src="S5LV0670P0I1099"/&gt;&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 71&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;review will run in parallel to the review into medical issues being conducted by Sir Liam Donaldson. It will consider and advise me about the measures needed to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06516"&gt;strengthen procedures for ensuring that the performance or conduct of non-medical health professionals and other healthcare staff does not pose a threat to patient safety or the effective functioning of services, particularly focusing on the effective and fair operation of fitness to practise procedures;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06517"&gt;ensure the operation of effective systems of continuing professional development and appraisal for non-medical healthcare staff and make progress towards regular revalidation where this is appropriate; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06518"&gt;ensure the effective regulation of healthcare staff working in new roles within the healthcare sector and of other staff in regular contact with patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06519"&gt;In the light of the above, it will further consider and recommend any changes needed to the role, structure, functions and number of regulators of non-medical healthcare professional staff. The director of Workforce is likely to report his conclusions and recommendations to me towards the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06520"&gt;As with CMO&apos;s review, there will be an advisory group, which will include experts from non-medical regulators and from the NHS. A larger reference group, which will include education and training&#x000A;&lt;col&gt;WS 72&lt;/col&gt;&#x000A;bodies and professional organisations as well as consumer and healthcare quality interests, will also support this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="S5LV0670P0-06521"&gt;The members of the advisory group are:&#x000A;&lt;table&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Andrew Foster (Chair)&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Director of Workforce, Department of Health (DH)&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Chris Beasley&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Chief Nursing Officer&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Kay East&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Chief Health Professions Officer&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Professor Sue Hill&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Chief Scientific Officer&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Professor Raman Bedi&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Chief Dental Officer&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Dr Jim Smith&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Chief Pharmaceutical Officer&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Harry Cayton&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Director of Patient and Public, DH&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Jane Wesson&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Chairman, Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence (CHRE)&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Sandy Forrest&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Director, CHRE&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Steve Barnet&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Director, NHS Employers&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Alastair Henderson&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Deputy Director, NHS Employers&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Jonathan Asbridge&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;President, Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC)&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Sarah Thewlis&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Chief Executive, NMC&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Norma Brook&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;President, Health Professions Council (HPC)&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Marc Seale&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Chief Executive, HPC&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Nic Greenfield&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Deputy Director of Workforce, DH&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Steve Catling&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;td&gt;Head of Professional Standards, DH&lt;/td&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/tr&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/table&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/p&gt;' title="NHS: Non-medical Professions' Review" type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_statements/2005/mar/17/nhs-non-medical-professions-review'></outline>
