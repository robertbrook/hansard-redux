          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0668P0-05251">My honourable friend the Minister of State, Department of Health (Ms Rosie Winterton) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0668P0-05252">Today we are publishing <span class="italic">Delivering Race Equality in Mental Health Care: An Action Plan for Reform Inside and Outside Services</span> (DRE), combined in a single document with the Government's response to the independent inquiry into the death of David Bennett.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_16ws' title='Col. 16WS &mdash; HL Deb 11 January 2005 vol 668 c16WS' name='column_16ws' href='#column_16ws' rel='bookmark'>16WS</a><p id="S5LV0668P0-05253">It draws on three key recent publications:
          <ol>
          <li>(a) <i>Inside Outside: Improving Mental Health Services for Black and Minority Ethnic Communities in England</i> (published on 10 March 2003);</li>
          <li>(b) <i>Delivering Race Equality: A Framework for Action</i> published for consultation on 17 October 2003); and</li>
          <li>(c) the independent inquiry into the death of David Bennett (published on 12 February 2004.</li>
          </ol>
          </p><p id="S5LV0668P0-05254">David Bennett was a 38 year-old African-Caribbean patient, who died in October 1998 in a medium secure psychiatric unit after being restrained by staff. The document published today contains the Government's formal response to all the recommendations made in the report of the inquiry into his death. The responses are overwhelmingly positive and, taken together with DRE, comprise a coherent programme of work for achieving equality of access, experience and outcomes for black and minority ethnic mental health service users.</p><p id="S5LV0668P0-05255">The programme is based on three "building blocks", first proposed in the consultation version of DRE: more appropriate and responsive services (including the development of a more culturally capable workforce); community engagement (supported by 500 new community development workers); and better information (including a new annual census of mental health patients).</p><p id="S5LV0668P0-05256">DRE also needs to be set in the context of our wider programme of work tackling inequalities in health and social care. For example, in February 2004 the chief executive of the NHS, Sir Nigel Crisp, launched a 10-point race equality action plan that challenges all NHS leaders to address race equality and the needs of black and minority ethnic communities in a systematic and professional way. In October 2004 we appointed the first equality and human rights director for the NHS, Surinder Sharma, and one of his priorities will be to promote Sir Nigel's plan.</p><p id="S5LV0668P0-05257">Racism or discrimination in any form has no place in modern society, and no place in modern health or social care. David Bennett's death will remain a tragic reminder of what can happen if services fail to meet the needs of black and minority ethnic communities and individuals. With this document we offer a clear way forward to equity for all in mental health care.</p>
