Ministers, certain bodies and office holders in charge of departments(1) were given delegated authority from 1 February 2004 under the <a href="/acts/civil-service-management-functions-act-1992">Civil Service (Management Functions) Act 1992</a> to:

          <li>(b) determine in relation to home civil servants in their respective departments or bodies the number and grading of posts (with the exception of those in the senior Civil Service) and the terms and conditions of employment in so far as they relate to:</li>
          <ol>
          <li>(i) classification of staff (with the exception of those in the senior Civil Service);</li>

          <li>(v) holidays, hours of work and attendance;</li>
          <li>(vi) part-time and other working arrangements;</li>
          <li>(vii) performance and promotion;</li>
          <col>WS 26</col>
          <li>(viii) retirement age (with the exception of those in the senior Civil Service);</li>
          <li>(ix) redundancy;</li>
