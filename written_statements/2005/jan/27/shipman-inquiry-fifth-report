          <cite class='member author entry-title'><a href="/people/mr-norman-warner" title="Mr Norman Warner">The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Warner)</a></cite>
          <p class="first-para" id="S5LV0668P0-05477">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p id="S5LV0668P0-05478">In December, my noble friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Lord Warner) announced that the launch of the General Medical Council's revalidation scheme should not start until doubts raised by Dame Janet Smith had been resolved. He said that it would be unfair to doctors and confusing for patients to start the new revalidation scheme until the question marks raised by Dame Janet on the evidence doctors would be required to submit had been answered.</p><p id="S5LV0668P0-05479">His announcement followed the publication of the fifth Shipman Report, <span class="italic">Safeguarding Patients: Lessons from the past&#x2014;Proposals for the Future</span>. In her report, Dame Janet Smith made it clear that she had concerns that the GMC's revised fitness to practise and revalidation procedures would not help to improve patient protection or safety sufficiently.</p><p id="S5LV0668P0-05480">I take what Dame Janet has said very seriously. I am determined to respond carefully and robustly to her recommendations to ensure that we develop a very strong patient protection plan. We want to put an end to the idea that the General Medical Council is a representative body for doctors. It is not. Its primary role must be to protect patients.</p><p id="S5LV0668P0-05481">In order to ensure that it does this effectively I have asked the Chief Medical Officer for England, Sir Liam Donaldson to undertake a review and report his advice to me on what further measures are necessary to:
          <ul>
          <li>strengthen procedures for assuring the safety of patients in situations where a doctor's performance or conduct pose a risk to patient safety or the effective functioning of services;</li>
          <li>ensure the operation of an effective system of revalidation; and</li>
          <li>reconfigure the role, structure and functions of the General Medical Council.</li>
          </ul>
          </p><p id="S5LV0668P0-05482">I have asked the Chief Medical Officer to report to me later this year. This will minimise any delay to the introduction of measures that will both improve patient safety and ensure that doctors are fit to practise. The Chief Medical Officer will put an emphasis on patient safety. He will draw on the findings and recommendations made by Dame Janet and other inquiries on poor clinical performance and misconduct. An advisory group that includes experts from organisations representing consumer, healthcare quality and professional interests will support him.</p><a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_61ws' title='Col. 61WS &mdash; HL Deb 27 January 2005 vol 668 c61WS' name='column_61ws' href='#column_61ws' rel='bookmark'>61WS</a><p id="S5LV0668P0-05483">Dame Janet made a number of recommendations not directly covered by the terms of reference of the Chief Medical Officer's review. Our consideration of these recommendations will continue in parallel to the work of the review, focusing particularly on improving measures designed to safeguard patients and improve the quality of the services provided to them.</p><p id="S5LV0668P0-05484">The full list of interest groups represented on the CMO's advisory group are:
