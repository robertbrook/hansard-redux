          <p class='first-para'>
            The debate is a tremendous opportunity to raise the real concerns of my constituents and of businesses, the local authority and community representatives in my constituency.</p><p>
            Our deep-rooted concerns result from Railtrack's commercial intention significantly to increase the number of freight trains passing through Lincoln without considering how that change might be managed to ensure that the city is not brought to a standstill. I share the fears of my constituents that, with the present road and rail layout, a further increase in rail traffic will be a burden rather than a bonus to the city.</p><p>
            I was determined to secure this parliamentary time to raise local issues because they highlight principles of wider significance, most notably the shortcomings of the <a href="/acts/railways-act-1993">Railways Act 1993</a> and of the fact that Railtrack is singularly and in my view unreasonably focused only on its part of the picture. I hope that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions will be able to assist in keeping the whole picture in our collective sight.</p><p>
            In using this opportunity to speak up for Lincoln, I wish to thank and pay tribute to those who have worked with me, some of whom are in the Chamber today. The rail forum includes representatives from Lincoln city council, Lincolnshire county council, the local chamber of commerce, Lincolnshire training and enterprise council and the university. I also thank the many individuals, including Mr. Carter, a retired railway man, who have taken the time to write, as well as the emergency services, including the fire service, and community groups such as the soroptomists society and the local media. That cross-section of opinion provides a measure of the overwhelming feeling of people in Lincoln. Everyone concerned has given the subject a good and open airing, which has informed the many aspects of the debate. It has been an important means of sending the message to Railtrack that it needs to work with us all to find a long-term solution that satisfies all parties.</p><p>
            The problem to which a solution must be found arises from Railtrack's intention to upgrade the east coast main line and develop the route to carry more passenger trains, faster trains and more freight services. To deliver those services, Railtrack intends to separate high-speed trains from slower trains by creating a four-track railway for much of the route. That will include a second parallel railway to the east coast main line, which will serve as a freight route.</p><p>
            What will that mean for Lincoln? In essence, there will be two extra freight trains an hour in each direction, and an increase in passenger services. Why does that present Lincoln with a problem? Lincoln has the rare distinction of having a railway line cut through the centre of the city, which necessitates a level crossing. When the barriers are closed, the railway cuts the high street in half for traffic and pedestrians alike. That now happens for 12 minutes in every hour, and it already causes congestion and inconvenience. It is estimated that the four extra rail freight journeys each hour will result in the barriers being closed for between 24 and 28 minutes an hour.</p><p>
            
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_335wh' title='Col. 335WH &mdash; HC Deb 22 February 2000 vol 344 c335WH' name='column_335wh' href='#column_335wh' rel='bookmark'>335WH</a>
            In January, I invited Railtrack executives to Lincoln to meet representatives from the rail forum. When asked at what point they would consider having to make alternative arrangements, they stated that the barriers would need to be down for about 40 minutes in every hour before they would feel compelled to act. Letting the high street of a vibrant city become impassable for 40 minutes in every hour is not good enough. If the increased freight traffic results in a down-time of 28 minutes, it will not take many passenger trains to cut the city in two for 40 minutes an hour.</p><p>
            To shed some light on the way forward, I refer to the joint statement from the rail forum. It states:
            <q>Railtrack's intention to invest in Lincolnshire railways as part of its east coast main line investment is, in principle, welcomed.</q>
            <q>Strong reservations are held in respect of the detailed proposals presently under active consideration due to their severe adverse effects on the city of Lincoln. Railtrack must ensure that full and proper consideration be given to finding a long-term strategic solution that avoids or minimises the unacceptable severance consequential with the present proposals.</q>
            I, too, am a great advocate of investment and development. I should very much like Lincoln to be at the heart of an improved road and rail network. We have already made considerable progress with the Government's much welcomed agreement to dual the A46 road between Newark and Lincoln. Railtrack's plans could bring even greater improvements, but not if it fails to accept its responsibilities to the people of Lincoln. The issue has generated much heat and, on Railtrack's part, little light. I have used every opportunity to raise the matter in Parliament, with Ministers and with Railtrack executives. Next month, at my request, I shall meet the chief executive of Railtrack, Mr. Corbett. I want to impress on him the need for Railtrack to consult and inform in a more meaningful way than it has done to date. Furthermore, Railtrack needs to be committed to finding a properly managed and funded solution to a fundamental change that will literally cut deeper into the heart of Lincoln.</p><p>
            The difficulties of congestion and severance caused by the location of the railway line have so far been undesirable, yet manageable to some extent as the area round the railway has been underutilised. However, that area is now a major focus of development as Lincoln goes from strength to strength as a tourist, shopping, education and employment centre, securing millions of pounds of Government money for regeneration.</p><p>
            In recent months, confidence in the city has been reflected in announcements that we are to have a new multiplex cinema and a new BT call centre with 900 jobs, and the confirmation, only last month, of the acquisition by Dynex Semiconductor, a Canadian company, of the Mitel factory on Doddington road, securing 350 jobs. The new university&#x2014;the first in 25 years to be purpose-built in this country&#x2014;goes from strength to strength while the associated housing, cultural and social developments also make their contribution to the economy.</p><p>
            My constituents identify strongly with their city. They are proud of it and the list I have given shows how justified that pride is. Lincoln has a rich heritage and an exciting future. The most commonly asked question
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_336wh' title='Col. 336WH &mdash; HC Deb 22 February 2000 vol 344 c336WH' name='column_336wh' href='#column_336wh' rel='bookmark'>336WH</a>
            about the unbelievable state of affairs that I have described is, "Can Railtrack really do this?" I regret that I am advised the answer is yes. We were let down by the previous Government, who, in pasing the <a href="/acts/railways-act-1993">Railways Act 1993</a>, which gave Railtrack its powers, took no account of the impact that proposals to increase rail traffic would have on a constituency such as Lincoln.</p><p>
            Last week we suffered an extra transport setback as the Conservative county council passed a budget that did not include the requisite &#x00A3;1 million to secure the potential route of the eastern relief road. That would have helped to alleviate our difficulties. Lincoln county council's financial approach disadvantages and thwarts my constituents at every turn by failing to obtain funds at very low interest rates for such long-term projects&#x2014;the opposite of the approach of most authorities.</p><p>
            Certain suggested diversions of traffic to avoid the railway line bring their own problems. It is fair to say that the matter is not new. Railway crossings in Lincoln have been a thorny issue across the centuries. The existence of a railway crossing in the centre of the city has always been the most contentious aspect of an unresolved debate. In May 1860, a headline in the <span class="italic">Lincolnshire Chronicle</span> asked "Who is to blame?" because of rail safety worries. Almost a century and a half later, in October 1999, the <span class="italic">Lincolnshire Echo</span> headline reading "Rail battle on track" shows that rail matters are still a cause for well-articulated outrage in my constituency. Pressure must be brought to bear on Railtrack to develop and execute the proper solution for my constituents.</p><p>
            On an environmental note, I have read the figures for the amount of pollution caused by traffic emissions. They measure nitrogen dioxide in parts per billion. Areas that are of potential concern are those in which traffic is expected to exceed 20,000 vehicles per day by 2005. The A15 at Pelham bridge and Broadgate has a permanent monitoring site at the drill hall which last year registered an average 34-plus parts per billion. The national guidelines set a target for the average, which should not exceed 21 parts per billion by the end of 2005. Lincoln has a potential pollution problem on its hands. It must not be worsened by the impact of rail developments on road traffic.</p><p>
            There are additional problems for the economy and the emergency services. Common sense tells us that if a city cannot be passed through at the High street for up to 40 minutes in any one hour, the ability of the emergency services to get where they need to be in the expected time will be greatly threatened. That is disturbing for my constituents. Likewise, increased traffic and pedestrian congestion is not conducive to businesses along and around the High Street doing well. I was staggered to read in a letter that Railtrack's chief executive sent to me on 9 August 1999 that
            <q>the issue of level crossing closures, including high street level crossings, has been made worse by the significant retail developments that have generated extra pedestrian and vehicular movements.</q>
            Is the success of Lincoln's commercial activity to be blamed for the limitations of the railway line?"</p><p>
            In the mid-19th century it seemed certain for a while that the main railway from London to the north would pass through Lincoln. It is often thought that this failed to materialise because of the attitude and influence of
            
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_337wh' title='Col. 337WH &mdash; HC Deb 22 February 2000 vol 344 c337WH' name='column_337wh' href='#column_337wh' rel='bookmark'>337WH</a>
            one of its two Members of Parliament, Colonel Sibthorpe, a Conservative with a reputation as a colourful character who first represented Lincoln in 1826. He was against the whole idea of railways, and enjoyed being a reactionary. I give the Chamber my assurance that, by contrast, the current Member of Parliament for Lincoln is greatly in favour of rail transport, and is keen for there to be an improved service to Lincoln. I ask my hon Friend the Minister to take full account of the comments that I have made on behalf of my constituents, including my reference to the lack of legislative protection for cities such as Lincoln. I hope that she will assist in bringing pressure to bear on Railtrack to get it to work with representatives in Lincoln to bring benefits rather than burdens to the city.

          <p class='first-para'>
            I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Lincoln (Gillian Merron) on securing the debate. She set out with characteristic clarity the issues that she sees facing Lincoln as a result of the impact of the proposed increase in rail movements through the city.</p><p>
            Lincoln is a renowned history city. It is an important sub-regional centre for the east midlands and it provides significant employment and local services to a growing urban population. My hon. Friend realises that good transport access will play a vital part in its future prosperity. I recognise my hon. Friend's interest in transport issues as well as the considerable amount of work that she has done in the Lincoln area. She has been successful in addressing road issues. She mentioned lobbying for the A46 Newark to Lincoln road dualling scheme, which is now due to start. The knowledge and understanding of rail issues that she has demonstrated today shows that, like the Government, she is multi-modal in addressing transport issues.</p><p>
            The level crossing in Lincoln high street has been a local feature since the 19th century and it causes delays for pedestrians and local traffic. Over many years development close to the railway has exacerbated the problem. Unlike the extract from the letter to which she referred, we must welcome that development. I know that my hon. Friend recognises the continued and considerable investment in the centre of Lincoln in recent years. The opening of the new Brayford bridge in 1997 provided some relief for the high street and an alternative route across the railway line. However, the continued increase in both rail and road traffic has seen congestion in the high street approach previous levels.</p><p>
            My hon. Friend's concern relates to Railtrack's proposals for the increased use of the railway for rail freight and the potential for even greater delays, as she graphically outlined, in the high street area. Irrespective of Railtrack's current proposals, the railway line through Lincoln provides an important link to the rest of Lincolnshire. The number of passenger trains is likely to grow. The high street level crossing and the effect that the resulting congestion has on business need to be considered. I fully understand my hon. Friend's concerns and those of the people of Lincoln about the issue.</p><p>
            It is Government policy, as set out in the transport White Paper, to support initiatives to carry more freight
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_338wh' title='Col. 338WH &mdash; HC Deb 22 February 2000 vol 344 c338WH' name='column_338wh' href='#column_338wh' rel='bookmark'>338WH</a>
            by rail. As my hon. Friend has made clear, the increased use of the Lincoln route by freight trains is part of Railtrack's wider plans to increase the passenger capacity of the east coast main line. In 1998, the Government set up the shadow Strategic Rail Authority to oversee and regulate the operations of the rail industry. The establishment of that authority means that developing rail freight will finally be part of the strategic management of the whole network and the whole rail sector. The shadow Strategic Rail Authority is now fully engaged in steering the future development of the network and integrating it with other forms of transport.</p><p>
            The transport White Paper announced the move from a mainly road-based assessment by highways authorities in their bids for local transport funding, to a more widely focused approach through the development of local transport plans, which need to address all forms of transport. Local transport plans are important in this context. The part that rail plays in transport provision must be seen as part of the Government's integrated transport policy, as set out in the transport White Paper.</p><p>
            There needs to be a partnership between transport operators, local authorities, business, local interest groups and users to ensure that all modes of transport are properly integrated and transport networks are operated effectively across all forms of transport. We also recognise the need for local involvement in seeking solutions to transport problems. We have asked local highway authorities to produce five-year local transport plans covering all transport provision within their area. The local transport plans were introduced last year as the basis for Government funding for local transport policy and priority. The extra &#x00A3;700 million provided over three years through those transport plans enabled the Government to begin to address the underfunding of transport that the previous Government permitted.</p><p>
            Local authorities, including Lincolnshire county council, submitted provisional plans in July 1999 and decisions on those were announced in December. We were pleased to see the amount of effort that local authorities put into developing plans in line with Government guidance. As part of the development of a local transport plan, we expect wide consultation with all transport users, operators and businessess, so that all relevant issues can be brought into the picture. That will help to develop a strategy to address local transport needs and it will apply in Lincoln, as elsewhere.</p><p>
            My hon. Friend will know that the development of Lincoln's local transport plan is the responsibility of the county council, which attempted in its preparation of the full plan to consult a wide section of interests, including the shadow Strategic Rail Authority, Railtrack, local authorities and others. The county council has the opportunity to continue the integrated transport approach that it outlined in its provisional plan. The wider focus that it adopts over transport issues should help to develop a longer-term transport strategy.</p><p>
            The provisional plan included a section on a potential candidate for a major tranport scheme close to Lincoln city centre, costing in excess of &#x00A3;5 million. The Lincoln railway corridor scheme was one of four major schemes throughout Lincolnshire identified in the provisional plan for which further clarification is expected in the full
            
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_339wh' title='Col. 339WH &mdash; HC Deb 22 February 2000 vol 344 c339WH' name='column_339wh' href='#column_339wh' rel='bookmark'>339WH</a>
            plans to be published later this year. Early indications from the county council suggest that the Lincoln railway corridor may not feature as a major scheme&#x2014;"major" accords with a specific definition in the guidelines based on cost. However, subject to further investigation, it could emerge as one of several related measures for Lincoln that will be identified in the full plan. It is important for my hon. Friend and other interested local people to grasp and pursue that point and I can tell her and her constituents that tackling congestion is central to the transport priorities of this historic city. We expect such priorities to be addressed as a pivotal feature of the full plan.</p><p>
            The county council and the city council are anxious that any future regeneration in the city centre should be sustainable. That led the county council to commission a central Lincoln development and transportation study. I understand that Railtrack is contributing towards the costs. A key element in the study will be an examination of the scope for alternative infrastructure options in the High street area in the light of the possible increase in the number of level crossing closures. I welcome that initiative, on which Railtrack, rail users and local businesses will be consulted. The study is expected to be completed in early July and its result should help to develop a strategy to address future needs and to indicate the scope of specific measures. I must tell my hon. Friend and the county council that if the main results of the study are to inform the content of the full local transport plan, which has to be produced for June, those time scales will have to be adapted. My hon. Friend will want to take that point back with her. The study offers potential, but its results must be known in time if they are to inform the full local transport plan.</p><p>
            Railtrack has issued a consultation document about its proposals for using the Lincoln line for re-routing freight trains off the east coast main line. Railtrack's current consultation and the transport study being undertaken by the county council have some common objectives. Railtrack has held a meeting with local councils and the chamber of commerce. It accepts that communication between all the parties needs to be improved.</p><p>
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_340wh' title='Col. 340WH &mdash; HC Deb 22 February 2000 vol 344 c340WH' name='column_340wh' href='#column_340wh' rel='bookmark'>340WH</a>
            I publicly take my hon. Friend's point that consultation by Railtrack must be meaningful and genuinely directed at achieving a long-term strategic solution. I expect close co-operation between the key partners so that the issues may be understood. The Government support local partnerships and consultations as the way forward on agreeing solutions to transport problems. Close dialogue and wider interest are needed to develop a workable strategy, which puts a responsibility on all partners, including operators, to engage in such a process and find local solutions.</p><p>
            The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is in regular contact with the county council via the Government office for the east midlands, and provides advice and assistance about the local transport plan. I have asked the Government office to assist in any way that it can the meetings between key partners that aim to secure agreement on the appropriate way forward for Lincoln.</p><p>
            The local issues identified by my hon. Friend must first be considered by the partners, including Railtrack, rail operators, Lincoln city council and Lincolnshire county council. Other interest groups must then be involved in the consultation on the local plan. I am pleased that my hon. Friend and local partners welcome the principle of an increase in investment on lines throughout Lincolnshire.</p><p>
            Increased investment in Lincoln is especially important to my hon. Friend although, as she pointed out, the consequences of that must be tackled. There is no alternative to a locally agreed solution. I encourage and expect all partners, including Railtrack, to work together to find one. Local solutions must recognise the needs of all rail users and take into account pedestrians, essential traffic access and legitimate business that has developed in the city centre.</p><p>
            I am sure that all partners subscribe to those goals and I wish them every success in pursuing them. Under the auspices of the Government office, the Department stands ready to play a full, constructive part in those discussions. I shall watch those discussions carefully and look forward to the partners working out a long-term strategic solution.
