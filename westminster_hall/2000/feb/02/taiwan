          <p class='first-para'>
            At the outset I declare an interest as the co-chairman, along with the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton), of the all-party British-Taiwanese group. We are an active group. We have an excellent relationship with His Excellency the Taiwanese representative to the United Kingdom, Mr. Loui Tzen, and his colleagues in London.</p><p>
            Taiwan and the UK enjoy an excellent relationship. Taiwan has been and is a major investor in this country, locating some of the most modern industrial enterprises here. With such investment have come some of the most advanced technological developments and many jobs throughout the country. One has only to speak to hon. Members to hear of the respect in which those companies are held by their work forces and local communities.</p><p>
            There are excellent commercial and financial arrangements between our two countries: 80 per cent. of Taiwan's European investment is in the UK. The British-Taiwanese business council is a very active organisation which discusses trade between our two countries. It held a major conference in London in January. More than 70 constituencies contain a company or companies of Taiwanese origin. That shows Taiwan's involvement in this country.</p><p>
            Yesterday, I showed around the House a group of young Taiwanese diplomats who are on a year's study at Oxford. Given that there were no financial restrictions on their studies, they could have chosen to go to any country. Each year, a further 13,000 Taiwanese students study here.</p><p>
            Taiwan has a population of 21 million and one of the strongest economies in the world&#x2014;at present, ranking 15th strongest. Against that background, it is appropriate to highlight the call on the British Government and their people to support Taiwan's application for observer status in the World Health Organisation.</p><p>
            As a major world economic power, Taiwan has an excellent health service. Its doctors and nurses have trained or studied in some of the world's major medical schools. One of the most modern hospitals in this country, St. George's, Tooting, in my constituency, was recently visited by the Taiwan Health Minister, himself a doctor. It soon became clear in discussions during that visit that Taiwan's wide range of medical and health services are equal to anything in the United Kingdom. Despite such quality, it is not a member of the World Health Organisation. Let us be frank, that is not because of its medical standards, but because of political attitudes. In my view and that of many others, that is totally unacceptable.</p><p>
            I chair the Social, Health and Family Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. In Strasbourg last week, we discussed a report on European health policy, which I have with me today. The debate highlighted how much the Council of Europe's 41 member states appreciate the opportunity to meet and discuss relevant health issues and progress in treatment and research. Taiwan seeks
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_246wh' title='Col. 246WH &mdash; HC Deb 02 February 2000 vol 343 c246WH' name='column_246wh' href='#column_246wh' rel='bookmark'>246WH</a>
            such involvement in WHO, which would enable its medical professionals to share their knowledge and skill with their international colleagues.</p><p>
            As Taiwan does not have WHO observer status, it cannot discuss wide-ranging and often complex technological developments or disease control with WHO members. It can neither obtain information on new health care and policies by working directly with WHO and its members nor take part in seminars or training programmes that are organised by WHO. How can that be realistic or fair?</p><p>
            Governments are not always those with skills for or the sole agents of world health developments. The medical profession uses its skills to build health policies, sustain health activity and broaden health strategies, which we all know are wide ranging and affected by economic and social behaviour and scientific and technological development. Countries such as Taiwan want to exchange skills and to learn about other countries' medical developments. Such exchange, above all else, is the role of the World Health Organisation&#x2014;and why Taiwan seeks observer status in it.</p><p>
            This country enjoys excellent medical services, but we share our skills, learn from other countries and are actively involved in WHO. So many of the developments that we talk about have been made as a result of international co-operation. We have been able to progress our skills in the fields of primary health care, vaccines, AIDS and HIV, family planning, health insurance policy, health information and expenditure and immunisation through co-operation with other countries. We have been able to work together to promote health and the welfare of people not only in this country but world wide. That is what Taiwan seeks in observer status.</p><p>
            In recent years, Taiwan has sent more than 400 medical personnel, who work in different areas of health care, to countries such as the United States of America, the UK, Japan, Australia and New Zealand for advanced health and medical training. On that ground, Taiwan is more than worthy of WHO observer status.</p><p>
            The case that I have presented is very strong, but support for Taiwan's application can be found in organisations that are far more influential. A letter dated 12 January from Professor Vivienne Nathanson, head of the professional resources and research group of the British Medical Association, states:
            <q>It would certainly be desirable for the medical profession in Taiwan to enjoy the advantages offered by links with the WHO, and we should therefore certainly support its application for observer status.</q>
            That is a very powerful endorsement which cannot easily be ignored.</p><p>
            The other comment I wish to quote is drawn from a document of the 106th Congress of the United States of America, dated 6 January 1999 and headed "Concerning the participation of Taiwan in the World Health Organization". It states:
            <q>The World Health Organization &#x2026; set forth in the first chapter of its charter the objective of attaining the highest possible level of health for all people &#x2026; Taiwan's population of 21,000,000 people is larger than that of three-fourths of the member states already in the World Health Organization &#x2026; Taiwan's achievements in the field of health are substantial, including one of the highest life expectancy levels in Asia, maternal and infant mortality rates comparable to those of western countries, the
            
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_247wh' title='Col. 247WH &mdash; HC Deb 02 February 2000 vol 343 c247WH' name='column_247wh' href='#column_247wh' rel='bookmark'>247WH</a>
            eradication of such infectious diseases as cholera, smallpox, and the plague, and the first to be rid of polio and provide children with free hepatitis B vaccinations &#x2026; The World Health Organization allows observers to participate in the activities of the organization &#x2026; In light of all the benefits that Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization could bring to the state of health not only in Taiwan, but also regionally and globally, Taiwan and its 21,000,000 people should have appropriate and meaningful participation in the World Health Organization.</q>
            That is a powerful recommendation and expression of support for Taiwan.</p><p>
            What is the view of the British Government? We have a good relationship with Taiwan, whose people have brought great benefit to the United Kingdom. I have quoted correspondence that clearly supports Taiwan's request for observer status within WHO. Does the UK support that request? If we do, what shall we do to support Taiwan in the coming months before the next WHO meeting in the Geneva? If we do not, will my hon. Friend the Minister clearly state the reasons in his reply? In my view and that of many others, Taiwan should be supported in its request. Taiwan and its many friends here in the UK Parliament, in business and in the financial community in this country, will be greatly interested to learn of the views of the British Government and their attitude to Taiwan's request for observer status within WHO.</p><p>

          <p class='first-para'>
            I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr. Cox) for having raised the subject of Taiwan and its relationship with the World Health Organisation. He is well known and rightly respected for the disinterested fashion in which he draws attention to Taiwan and ensures that it is not forgotten by the House of Commons. His efforts and his serious interest in Taiwan are appreciated.</p><p>
            Although there are obvious political constraints on our relationship with Taiwan, I fully agree with my hon. Friend that we need to take Taiwan seriously. I assure the House that the Government do so and that we are looking for ways to strengthen and develop that relationship. I welcome and fully concur with my hon. Friend's remarks on the excellent state of relations between Taiwan and Britain. I hope that we can continue to build on that.</p><p>
            It is fair to say that the question of Taiwan's relationship with WHO, or with any other international organisation or element in the international community, cannot be considered without taking into account the complex issue of Taiwan's international status and the effect that that has on Taiwan's ability to play a fully recognised international role. The whole international community, not only the UK, are involved in that issue.</p><p>
            The House will be aware of the UK Government's formal policy on the status of Taiwan, which was laid down in 1972 when the UK upgraded relations with the People's Republic of China to ambassadorial level. In a joint communique agreed with the Chinese Government and announced on 13 March 1972, the UK Government of the day stated that the UK recognised the Government of the People's Republic of China as the
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_248wh' title='Col. 248WH &mdash; HC Deb 02 February 2000 vol 343 c248WH' name='column_248wh' href='#column_248wh' rel='bookmark'>248WH</a>
            sole legal Government of China, and acknowledged the position of the People's Republic of China that Taiwan is a province of China. That remains our policy and forms the foundation of our dealings with Taiwan.</p><p>
            It follows that the UK has no formal political or diplomatic relations with Taiwan. That is not an unusual or unique position; it is shared by most other countries in the world, including our European partners and other close partners such as the United States. Although the precise formulation may differ slightly from one country to another, all have adopted a similar view and operate under similar constraints in their political dealings with Taiwan and its authorities. Only a handful of countries currently afford full diplomatic recognition to Taiwan as the "Republic of China". That position is unlikely to change significantly in the near future.</p><p>
            Taiwan's lack of widespread international recognition has obvious consequences for Taiwan's aspirations to membership of international organisations, especially those, such as WHO, whose membership is limited to states. As neither the UK nor the United Nations, where the People's Republic of China has had a seat since 1971, recognises Taiwan as a state, it follows that we cannot support Taiwan's membership of international organisations that only states may join.</p><p>
            However, we are keen to find creative ways in which Taiwan can play a role in the international community, consistent with our policy on recognition while allowing Taiwan's commercial and economic significance and its medical expertise to be properly reflected and embraced by the international community. For example, we look forward to Taiwan joining the World Trade Organisation, under the right terms, in its capacity as the customs territory of Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu.</p><p>
            Although there are constraints on the extent to which we can develop a political relationship with Taiwan, in many other respects&#x2014;including, but not solely, trade and commerce&#x2014;we are trying to build a strong and fruitful relationship with Taiwan and its people. As my hon. Friend said, Taiwan has a vibrant, powerful economy: it is the world's 14th largest trading entity and its transformation from an almost entirely agrarian economy to a leading industrial economy is phenomenal&#x2014;one of the economic miracles of Asia. Its economy is shifting to new technologies to become a high-tech knowledge-driven economy of the future. Taiwan is at the leading edge.</p><p>
            We have a long history of trade and economic relations&#x2014;and personal relations&#x2014;with Taiwan. I am grateful that my hon. Friend has shown people around the House to make sure that those personal relationships deepen. That and his showing a representative of Taiwan around a hospital in his constituency are much appreciated. In the past decade, with one or two blips such as in 1998, during the Asian financial crisis, our exports to Taiwan have shown a steady upward trend. The 1999 figures will show a slight recovery: although they will not achieve the &#x00A3;1 billion of exports that we achieved in 1997, there may be a marginal increase on 1998 levels, which shows that the tide is turning.</p><p>
            
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_249wh' title='Col. 249WH &mdash; HC Deb 02 February 2000 vol 343 c249WH' name='column_249wh' href='#column_249wh' rel='bookmark'>249WH</a>
            Imports from Taiwan are now well over twice the level of exports and are rising steadily. As my hon. Friend spelt out, Taiwan is an important investor in the United Kingdom. We are pleased that Taiwan sees Britain as a gateway to Europe. We have attracted almost 85 per cent. of Taiwan's total investment in the European Union. Major developments include the Chung-hwa picture tubes factory in Scotland, which was opened by Her Majesty the Queen in October 1997. That brought 3,000 new jobs to Scotland and is the largest single Taiwanese investment in Europe. We want more investment from Taiwan. At the same time, we are substantial investors in Taiwan and we are working to support British investors there. The Government are keen to promote those activities. The British trade and cultural office in Taipei, our unofficial representation there, is specifically tasked to support British trading and business interests.</p><p>
            We encourage private ministerial visits to Taiwan by Ministers whose responsibilities lie in areas in which our links with Taiwan are strong. The Minister of State, Scotland Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson), who was the Minister for Trade at the time, visited Taiwan last year. The present Minister for Trade, my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn), will visit Taiwan in two weeks. We want to keep ministerial visits, although they are private, as continuous, close, personal links with Taiwan, and we hope that there will be many more such visits in both directions in the future.</p><p>
            The relationship is far more than simply commercial. It is not based solely on trade and commerce. My hon. Friend spoke eloquently about medical exchanges and the development of Taiwan's medical contribution internationally. I welcome his words and look forward, as he does, to deepening those highly professional exchanges. I welcome the fact that the Taiwanese Minister for Health was one of the first senior Taiwanese visitors to this country since our Government took office.</p><p>
            Britain and Taiwan have much to learn from each other in medical practice and training, and that is precisely the sort of exchange that we should develop, so that we can learn from each other, to mutual benefit and the benefit of our planet. We are eager to promote people-to-people exchanges in education, culture, science and medicine.</p><p>
            As my hon. Friend said, Taiwan is a highly educated society which places a high value on education at all levels. We are pleased that the UK has been an important destination for Taiwanese people who want to study abroad. There are 15,000 Taiwanese studying at British universities and other institutes of further education in Britain. They are most welcome. They bring new perspectives to our institutions. They make a contribution; they do not just study, collect information and go away again. They help to transform the environment in which they are studying. According to the latest figures, more than 50,000 Taiwanese tourists came to Britain in 1997. Such exchanges are important and help to bind us together.</p><p>
            The key question posed by my hon. Friend was Taiwan's relationship with the World Health Organisation. He made an eloquent case expressing the desire of the Taiwanese authorities to gain observer status at WHO. It is no part of my purpose to deny the
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_250wh' title='Col. 250WH &mdash; HC Deb 02 February 2000 vol 343 c250WH' name='column_250wh' href='#column_250wh' rel='bookmark'>250WH</a>
            strength of those feelings or to question them. We believe that, wherever possible and appropriate, Taiwan's aspirations should be considered sympathetically.</p><p>
            However, the political realities and China's likely objections cannot be ignored and wished away. Taiwan's health care is undoubtedly of a high calibre, as befits a highly developed economy such as that of Taiwan. It is therefore no surprise that the medical profession in Taiwan should seek to be associated with the World Health Organisation, one of the world's principal medical forums, and that there should be strong backing in parts of the international medical community for contacts with Taiwan. The House and my hon. Friend are aware of the practical problems.</p><p>
            I have outlined the problem of Taiwan's membership of international bodies whose membership is limited to states. One possible way forward that has been canvassed is for Taiwan to seek observer status. Some organisations, including some non-governmental organisations, are already observers. There is no formal mechanism whereby entities that aspire to such status may apply to become observers. I believe that I am correctly informed that Taiwan has not applied for such status.</p><p>
            I understand that the director general of WHO has discretion to confer observer status on a non-state entity where its participation would be non-controversial. She has not done so to date, but there is no harm in considering that as a possible way forward.</p><p>
            The only route to the attainment of observer status is for a proposal to be made in favour of the aspirant by a full member of the World Health Organisation at the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly. It is open to the Taiwanese authorities to pursue that route, as they have done for a number of years. Any application put before the assembly's general committee stands to undergo rigorous examination by all member Governments, including the Chinese. If Taiwan and China could agree between themselves on suitable conditions for Taiwan's entry, that would ease the process considerably.</p><p>
            I hope that I have made it clear in response to my hon. Friend's passionate and well-reasoned case that our Government are fully aware of the medical work undertaken in Taiwan, and of the importance that Taiwanese authorities attach to the possibility of Taiwan's playing an international role within WHO. We hope that a satisfactory solution can be found.</p><p>
            We cannot be starry-eyed and simply wish our way into the future. There are practical and political obstacles on the way, but we should do our best to set out the case and to enable negotiations to take place, so that the medical expertise that exists in Taiwan can be afforded its true status and recognised internationally, and so that Taiwan can make an international contribution, which could be to the benefit of the whole of humanity.
