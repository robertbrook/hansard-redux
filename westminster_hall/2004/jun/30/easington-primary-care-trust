            Although Easington primary care trust is the prime provider of primary health care and the principal commissioner of secondary health care for my constituents, I should point out the fact that five of the most deprived local government wards&#x2014;Wingate, Wheatley Hill, Thornley, Deaf Hill and Hutton Henry&#x2014;which suffer some of the worst ill health in the Easington PCT area, are in the Sedgefield constituency of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. Easington PCT covers 26 local government wards and is responsible for health care for 93,900 people who reside in east Durham.

            This is the second Adjournment debate that I have initiated on this issue, and although some progress has been made since the first debate in June 2002, I feel that I must keep up the pressure on Ministers for an equitable settlement for my constituents.

            I begin by stating for the record that credit must be given to the Government for a record increase in funding for primary care. A 39 per cent. increase was awarded to Easington PCT over the current three-year funding allocation period of 2003&#x2013;2006, compared with a national average increase of 29 per cent. Nevertheless, the size of the percentage increase must be put in context against the background of a relatively low baseline. Health inequality, like deprivation, poverty and affluence, is a relative concept. Easington PCT is &#x00A3;26 million a year short of the baseline resources required to deliver adequate health care to the people in east Durham.

            A much more substantial increase is needed to address the historic underfunding of health care in the former mining communities in east Durham. Resources are needed to meet local health need and address the inequalities in health, an aim which the Secretary of State described as one of the cornerstones of the Government's social policy, and which was identified as one of his four key priorities in his speech to the NHS Confederation conference in Glasgow on 26 June 2003. At the present rate of catch-up&#x2014;approximately 2 per cent. per year&#x2014;it would take 20 years for Easington PCT to reach the target. That is clearly too long. Over the three years from 2003 to 2006, the health economy of east Durham is being deprived of &#x00A3;78 million in funding. That is a huge gap, which must be bridged.

            Properly targeted, &#x00A3;78 million of additional resources could significantly improve the health of the local population. Easington PCT is more than 20 per cent. under target in the current financial year. The Secretary of State's reply to my parliamentary question in November 2003 showed that Easington PCT is the worst funded of the 304 PCTs in the country. The league table published in response to that parliamentary question shows clearly that although Easington PCT covers an area that is one of the most deprived by any accepted measure and suffers high levels of chronic ill health, it is funded at only 80 per cent. of target. At the

            other end of the scale, Kensington and Chelsea PCT and Westminster PCT, which cover relatively affluent areas, are funded well above target&#x2014;at 130 per cent. in the case of Westminster PCT.

            I fully understand that Ministers are required to strike a balance between how much is awarded to PCTs as a whole to maintain continuity and stability in the service and how much extra is awarded to under-resourced PCTs such as Easington to bring them up to target. It is important to recognise that not all PCTs are the same, and the needs of the populations that they serve are different.

            I do not intend to develop the argument in this debate, but it would be perfectly reasonable to put forward the case that deprived communities such as Easington, suffering high levels of chronic ill health, should be funded well beyond target, compared with more affluent areas like Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea. I do not, however, seek a reduction in provision or to destabilise the system for anyone. All I seek is an uplift in the funding for Easington PCT to get it within striking distance of the target.

            What I am looking for in this debate is some indication, or better still a clear statement from the Minister, that when a PCT is both under target allocation and significantly deprived, as Easington is, special measures should be applied to the allocation formula under a heading such as health needs or health inequalities readjustment. It is unjust that the district of Easington is consistently identified in the indices of multiple deprivation as one of the most deprived communities outside inner London, yet has the worst funded PCT in England.

            There are a number of deficiencies in health provision that must be addressed in the short term if we are to make progress in improving the overall health of the population in the Easington PCT area. To begin with, there is an identified need for double the number of practice nurses in Easington. There are no hypertension, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or diabetes clinics currently operating in my PCT area. All the GP practices in the Easington PCT area require and have requested additional nursing resources to improve the management of chronic disease.

            We need more funding for mental health services, which have traditionally been a Cinderella service both nationally and locally when it comes to resource allocation. People living in east Durham are over 30 per cent. more likely than the national average to suffer from mental illness. GP practices have identified the need for their own community psychiatric nurses, as they would like to offer group therapy sessions and drop-in clinics for their patients. Some areas receive as little as three hours per week from community psychiatric nurses for counselling sessions.

            Providing resources to support GPs with a special interest who can offer secondary care services in the community would have the added benefits of taking pressure off the acute sector and relieving patients of the need to make long and difficult journeys by public transport to the nearest hospital. Easington, as the Minister may appreciate, does not have its own hospital. The acute hospitals serving my constituency are located in Sunderland, North Tees and Hartlepool, Stockton and Durham City.

            We need to develop our primary health care infrastructure in terms both of facilities and of the human resource element. New premises are urgently required in many communities. A recent report commissioned by the PCT indicates that health visitors and district nurses are currently working from inadequate premises. In some cases the premises are in a shocking and dilapidated condition, which is hardly the image that the NHS would wish to portray in the 21st century, particularly if we are to attract more staff, especially dedicated health care professionals, to work in the Easington PCT area.

            We desperately need more community nurses. Nurses working in east Durham tend to have large case loads&#x2014;twice as large as those in the neighbouring areas of Sunderland and Hartlepool. That means that our community nursing staff are working under intense pressure. They do not have time to promote health and give advice to their patients on healthy eating or smoking cessation, or offer general advice on how to maintain good health. The Wanless report highlighted the cost-effectiveness of investing in public health, but first there is a cost to be borne in having sufficient staff to promote good health interventions.

            There is an excellent, if rather depressing, report produced by the public health intelligence service and the County Durham and Tees Valley Public Health Network with the apt title of "Miserable Measures".

            The report uses the index of multiple deprivation to analyse the various strands&#x2014;or domains, as they are referred to&#x2014;of deprivation. They are housing, income, employment, health, education and child poverty. It may he useful at this point to consider the definition of deprivation in health terms. Deprivation has been defined and measured in many ways. It is a word used to convey the idea of an individual or a community being in need, and having unfulfilled needs in absolute or relative terms.

For the record, people living in Easington suffer both absolute and relative deprivation. As long ago as 1980, the Black report demonstrated the link between poverty, deprivation and ill health, and that link was reinforced by work carried out by Professor Townsend in the 1990s.

In effect, the health care professionals, GPs, community nurses, health visitors and so forth who are expected to improve the health of the population in my constituency are being asked to deliver five years of health care with four years of funding.

I respectfully point out to the Minister that the Secretary of State's warm words to the NHS Confederation and his reference to a commitment to address health inequalities in funding are not a test of political faith; they are more a test of political will. A promise is only a promise when it is delivered, and I am looking to the Minister for a commitment to address the funding anomaly that leaves health services for my constituents underfunded to the tune of &#x00A3;78 million over three years. In the short term, I am also seeking special measures to bring additional health resources to Easington to bring my PCT at least within striking distance of its target. That will allow the dedicated team of professionals that we have in place to get on with the job of improving health outcomes in one of the most deprived communities in the country.

            I await the Minister's response with great interest and, as a loyal member of the Labour party, some expectation. I remind her that with loyalty come obligations. The nation owes a debt of honour to mining communities such as Easington that have suffered ill health over many generations to produce the coal that the nation required The mines have closed but the legacy of ill health remains, and must be addressed if the Government's commitment to their heartlands and to social justice are to have any credence.

            There are a number of drivers for change across government, the NHS and the Department of Health. Ministers, including the Prime Minister, have put a real focus on making reducing health inequalities a top priority for the Government. Following the cross-cutting review, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister: Housing, Planning and Local Government Committee has responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the inequalities strategy. That will be crucial in ensuring that tackling health inequalities remains a key priority across government. Indeed, the NHS improvement plan explicitly sets out how the NHS will develop into a health service rather than one that focuses primarily on sickness, and will in partnership make further inroads into levels of smoking, obesity and the other major causes of disease. There will be a sustained drive to reduce inequalities in health.

            Strategic health authorities have a key role to play in performance managing health inequalities, not just on the key targets, but on other public health and health inequalities performance indicators and on progress with local delivery plans, which for the first time include tackling health inequalities as a priority. The recent launch of the consultation paper "Choosing Health?" was aimed at helping us put inequalities at the core of the nation's health. We want to use the consultation to promote a wide debate on the roles and responsibilities of individuals, the NHS and all the other players in civil society, as well as the Government, in the debate on choosing health.

The publication in July 2003 of "Tackling health inequalities: a programme for action" is an indication of our commitment to addressing this issue. The programme provides the basis of meeting the 2010 national health inequalities target on life expectancy, by geographical area, and on infant mortality, by social class, by building on current work, and addressing the wider causes of inequalities in years beyond.

            Key issues that are addressed in that programme are, first, health inequalities, which affect a large part of the population, not just the most deprived. Action to meet the targets will need to address the needs of the poorest 30 to 40 per cent. of the population. In the context of overall health improvement, the aim is to improve the health of the poorest fastest. Secondly, health inequalities must be integrated into mainstream service delivery, focusing on disadvantaged areas and groups, and recognising that a one-size-fits-all approach to health care will not reduce the health gap. Thirdly, co-ordinated effective activity is required across traditional boundaries at all levels, working in partnership with communities and service users.

It reduced the incidence of heart disease by 25 per cent. over a two-year period, and I commend the PCT and its partners for the progress that has been achieved in that area.

It is important to remember how much funding has been made available. In the 2002 Budget, the Chancellor announced the largest sustained increase in funding of any five-year period in the history of the NHS. Over the years 2003&#x2013;04 to 2007&#x2013;08, those plans mean that expenditure on the NHS in England will increase, on average, by 7.4 per cent. a year above inflation.

            All NHS organisations must be clear that they have a responsibility to manage their resources effectively. Although we expect overall financial balance across the NHS, that is not to say that there are no health bodies facing financial pressures.

            My hon. Friend addressed the issue of the allocation of resources to primary care trusts in considerable detail, and I emphasise that Easington PCT will receive an increase of &#x00A3;36 million over the three years from 2003&#x2013;04 to 2005&#x2013;06. That represents a cash increase of 41 per cent. I am, of course, aware that that will mean that the Easington PCT continues to receive less than its target share. However, the pace of change policy that we have adopted for 2003&#x2013;06 will reduce the PCT's distance from its target over the three-year period. For 2003&#x2013;04, Easington PCT was 22 per cent. under its target share, but by 2005&#x2013;06 it will be 16 per cent. under that target share. The allocations have been made direct to PCTs as part of the process of shifting the balance of power, by putting resources and responsibilities in the hands of front-line services. PCTs now control more than 75 per cent. of the NHS budget.

            In response to some of what my hon. Friend said, I can see that it is not unreasonable to ask why some PCTs continually receive less than their target share. Our pace of change policy involves a balance between how much we give to all PCTs to maintain continuity and stability and make progress nationally in priority areas, and how much extra we give to under-target PCTs to bring them nearer to their weighted capitation targets. Allocations to all PCTs include resources to finance the cost of pay reform, new drugs and treatments, and additional capacity. However, we have also given extra resources to under-target PCTs.
