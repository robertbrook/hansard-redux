            During 2002&#x2013;04, the Government supported almost 50 projects under the community safety challenge funding initiative. Of those, 15 included measures related to community safety and older people. The value of those projects was estimated at &#x00A3;55,000. The awards were made to community safety partnerships, including four to Ballymena, three to Banbridge, two to Armagh and one each to Belfast, Fermanagh, Larne, Limavady, Lisburn and Antrim.</p><p>
            In October 2003, the Government launched the lock out crime scheme, which will provide &#x00A3;2.25 million for the installation of security measures in the homes of older people during the next three financial years. Those measures will be available free of charge to those aged over 75 who are in receipt of housing benefit and rate rebate. The security features will include door and window locks, door bars, chains and external security lighting.

            I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. I welcome his visit to Northern Ireland, and will take him to Limavady, where he will learn how to pronounce that name. It is not in my constituency, so he will have to come to North Down first.</p><p>
            I welcome the Government's initiatives, but want to reflect on the answer, which I was given earlier, that there is no discrimination against elderly people. The Minister just said that the security measures are available only to those over 75 who are receiving housing benefit and who live in designated ward areas. Sadly, a gentleman called Mr. Ted O'Hare died in his home at the weekend as the result of a vicious attack during a burglary. He was 73, and would not have qualified. On Sunday afternoon, I visited two elderly constituents in North Down, both of whom have been burgled, but neither of whom would qualify under the criteria. One of them was intimidated by a young man in a balaclava wielding a gun, who threatened to shoot her dog. What criteria would accommodate such threats to elderly people in Northern Ireland? Will the Minister reflect on the importance of tight criteria and take into account the changes that are needed?

            First, I apologise to the good citizens of Limavady if I did not pronounce the name of their town
            <a class='permalink column-permalink' id='column_154wh' title='Col. 154WH &mdash; HC Deb 13 November 2003 vol 413 c154WH' name='column_154wh' href='#column_154wh' rel='bookmark'>154WH</a>
            properly. Northern Ireland is not normally part of my portfolio. I am afraid that that is the only excuse that I can offer.</p><p>
            The hon. Lady is absolutely right. Crime against anyone of any age is awful, but it is even more deplorable against older people. If we were to introduce the same measures for people aged between 60 and 75, it would cost about &#x00A3;25 million. We must draw a line somewhere. The Government believe that we should aim our resources at those aged over 75 because, according to the Northern Ireland crime survey, people over that age are more than two and a half times more likely to suffer from crime. However, I shall certainly pass the hon. Lady's comments on to my colleagues in the Northern Ireland Office and ask them to reflect on her constituents' experiences.
