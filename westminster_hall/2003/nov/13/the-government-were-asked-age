            Age discrimination can be as debilitating to individuals as other forms of discrimination. That is why we are tackling age discrimination in employment through our age positive campaign and through our code of practice on age diversity in employment. Legislation against age discrimination in employment and training will come into force in October 2006. We are tackling age discrimination in other arenas as well. The national service framework for the national health service is designed to outlaw and prevent age discrimination in our hospitals and other health care systems.

            The Minister's reply echoes the memorable words of the right hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney), now the Minister without Portfolio, who said that age discrimination practices

            The hon. Gentleman asked a long question. He may like a concise answer. We are doing a great deal. We have said that, for civil servants, the normal retirement age in the future will be 65, not 60.</p><p>
            I am also pleased that the employment rates&#x2014;economic activity rates&#x2014;are improving for those between 50 and the state pension age. We will outlaw discrimination. That is action from a Labour Government. I do not remember that happening during the Conservatives' 18 years.

            May I commend to the Minister the excellent campaign being run by the <span class="italic">Sunday Mirror</span> on respect for older people and draw his attention to the many facets of ageism that that campaign has highlighted in a survey of British seniors? May I press him specifically on age discrimination in the national health service? Just a couple of weeks ago, a leading conference organised by Cancer Research UK and Help the Aged highlighted the fact that elderly women over 70 are, because of their age, still being denied potentially life-saving surgery for breast cancer. That is happening two years after Ministers published a national service framework for older people and pledged to stamp it out. Why is it still occurring, and what will Ministers do about it?

            The question is asked at a time when our programme to help those with cancer is moving in the right direction and we are getting some very good results. I reiterate that my colleagues in the Department and all of us in the Government are determined to prevent any form of age discrimination from operating in the health service. If there are individual instances, such as those that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, I am sure that my colleagues in the Department of Health will consider them most carefully.

            The Government have released &#x00A3;5 billion of local authority council house sales receipts to spend on improvement of that stock. That will disproportionately benefit elderly people who, as the hon. Gentleman rightly points out, occupy that social housing.

            The hon. Gentleman has decided completely to ignore the facts that I stated. The Government have allowed the release of &#x00A3;5 billion of local authority council house sales receipts, which has been specifically identified for improving the quality of social housing. We are well on track to achieve our target of raising to a decent standard every social housing home by 2010. I would like to see the Conservative party make a pledge to match that spending and guarantee that we achieve improvement in social housing over the next five years.

            I asked a question a moment ago and, given that we are dealing with cross-cutting questions, I was taken aback not to receive a response from the Health Minister who is present. I made a very serious point that women over 70 are being denied health care. That allegation was made by Professor Ian Fentiman of Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' medical school. Will the Health Minister, in his cross-cutting role, provide me with an answer to what the Government are doing and why, when they made a commitment two years ago, nothing has improved?

            I reject that allegation. If the hon. Gentleman can provide evidence of discrimination, we will deal with it. We are committed to removing that sort of discrimination from the service.

            Will the three Ministers reflect on their human rights obligations? They will know that article 3 of the European convention on human rights guarantees to everyone within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom freedom from degrading treatment.

Can the Ministers put their hands on their hearts and say that the measures, legislation and procedures in practice guarantee freedom for elderly people from discrimination and degrading treatment?

            Yes, we can give that commitment. The Government will not tolerate age discrimination anywhere that we find it. If any Members have evidence of it, bring it to us, and we will deal with it.
