            "Give credit where it is due, and would you thank the Government from the bottom of my heart?" So speaks an ex-Conservative voter in Hamilton, South who received &#x00A3;46.20 in pension tax credit. However, there is concern regarding take-up. The Pension Service in Motherwell is in the constituency next door to mine. Would the Minister confirm that we have the resources to ensure that as many people as possible will receive personal information regarding the pension credit? Will he commit himself to ensuring that there are plenty of roadshows in my constituency and throughout the country, and will he ensure that adequate finance is available for that process?

            That is a very important question. We are absolutely determined that those entitled to pension credit should receive it. It is terrible to think that someone who could be better off by &#x00A3;30 or &#x00A3;40 a week will not hear about the pension credit. We all have a role to play.</p><p>
            Despite much irresponsible scaremongering, pension credit has got off to a very good start. We reported to the House earlier this week that already 1.4 million individuals are better off because of pension credit. However, locally through advice surgeries, home visiting and in all sort of other ways&#x2014;we need the advice of Members of Parliament about where best to locate advice surgeries&#x2014;we are enabling the message about pension credit to get through. We all have a duty to make it a success. We are talking about some of the poorest and most vulnerable elderly people. They deserve pension credit; I am determined that they should receive it.

            May I also commend to the House the campaign by the <span class="italic">Sunday Mirror</span> for respect for older people? In the implementation of the state pension credit, it is to the Government's credit that the check on the resources of people applying for the state pension credit will take place only every five years. That is an innovative way to show respect for older people while targeting the benefit at those who actually need it. In asking the Minister to make sure that the Government maximise the take-up of pension credit, I want him to minimise its take-up in one small respect by making sure that my constituents who used to work at Allied Steel and Wire and who have lost their pensions are compensated and therefore have no need to apply for it.

            Can the Minister confirm that far from getting off to a very good start the figures, that were produced two days ago show that only an extra 93,000 households out of a target of 1.2 million are getting the benefit? At that rate, it will take six and a half years for the Government to hit their modest targets. Can he confirm those figures? I am visiting the Pension Service in Eastbourne tomorrow and shall be keen to see whether the figures are borne out locally.

            I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will have a good visit and I should like to hear his impressions of it. Like many of us, he will be impressed by the Pension Service. When the shadow Secretary of State, who is the new director of policy development for the Conservative party, said how long it would take to reach our target on pension credit take-up, he was, with all due respect, talking nonsense and engaging in irresponsible scaremongering. I am confident that we will hit the target by 2006. It does not do much good if some people pretend that the pension credit is going badly when it is going very well. We all have a duty to try to ensure that people claim it.

            No, that is not the case. Some 4 million households are eligible, and our target is for 3 million households to receive the credit by 2006. The target is based on logistics and planning, but we want to go beyond it. My personal target is 100 per cent. take-up, because it is important that everyone who is entitled to the pension credit claims it. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Brennan) mentioned that the pension credit is 1 million miles away from the old-fashioned means test. The only thing that people must report is changes in their circumstances, and that will occur rarely. Allowing claims to be made over the telephone rather than by filling in a form is a new approach to targeting the poorest.

            As I have said before, my hon. Friend is a mighty champion for older people in his constituency. I thank him for that. It would probably be helpful if he and I could sit down together to consider the issue in detail. We obviously review the position and want to improve it, but the fact that elderly people do not have to fill in the form themselves&#x2014;it can be done over the telephone or during a home visit&#x2014;is a major breakthrough. If there are issues to resolve, however, I hope that my hon. Friend will accept my invitation to discuss them.

            The telephone claim system is a great step forward, backed up by home visits for those who request and need them. Can the Minister give us some idea as to how the telephone system has worked? Sometimes, with private call centres, for example, one has to hang on a long time before the call is answered, and one call is not sufficient. What is happening with the call centres of the Department for Work and Pensions?

            Performance has been good, even during the first week of pension credit when, from memory, we had 160,000 phone calls. We are currently receiving fewer than that, but 95 per cent. of them are answered within 30 seconds. The system is standing up very well. Clearly, if telephony is at the heart of the service, the telephones have to be answered. We monitor the centres carefully, and so far the performance has been excellent. I congratulate the people in our pension centres and in the pension credit application centre on doing a good job in offering that public service.

            If the use of call centres to apply for pension credit is so good, why did the <span class="italic">Sunday Mirror</span>&#x2014;of all newspapers&#x2014;say:
            <q>The very fact a senior has to pick up a phone, tell someone in a call centre they are poor, tell them how much money they have and ask 'can I have some more?' is very demeaning and straight out of a Dickens novel."?</q>
            That is the <span class="italic">Sunday Mirror's</span> verdict on this Government policy.

            The previous Government relied heavily on means-testing, but the old-fashioned sort. It was a weekly means test, and any savings were knocked off the means-tested benefit, pound for pound. Our system is a long way from that. We have a savings credit, and we are not worried about people with &#x00A3;6,000 of savings, and that includes some 85 per cent. of those who are entitled to the pension credit. With all due respect to the hon. Gentleman, how dare he lecture us about means-testing when his Government exercised that old-fashioned regime?</p><p>
            I do not think, from the evidence, that there is anything demeaning about having a 20-minute conversation to apply for pension credit. One of the wonderful things is that people who are eligible for pension credit are hearing for the first time about
