I shall raise a point of order in the Chamber after questions to try to ensure that we have a system that does not put us all in the position of having to adjourn a debate that could more easily be postponed until the important statement is over. In the circumstances, I am happy to agree with the Government's motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question put and agreed to.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adjourned accordingly at half-past Two o'clock.&lt;/i&gt;" title='The Financing of Terrorism in Northern Ireland' type='link' url='http://hansard.millbanksystems.comhttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/westminster_hall/2003/may/01/the-financing-of-terrorism-in-northern'></outline>
