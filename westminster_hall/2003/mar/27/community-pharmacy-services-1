            That figure underlines how important community pharmacists and pharmacies are to older people. I have spoken to many pharmacists in Kingston and Surbiton who tell me that most of their customers are pensioners and that such people rely heavily on their community pharmacist. Will the Minister go further than he has done and tell the House that he will seek a much earlier rejection of the OFT proposals? Does he

            If the sword of Damocles was hanging over community pharmacies, their representative bodies would be unlikely to support the Government. They are supporting the Government because we have been working with them for some time. We have been working with them on their contracts and the way in which they are reimbursed, and on the Office of Fair Trading report. <span class="italic">[Interruption.]</span> It is not a question of backing down, it is a question of supporting the NHS and community pharmacies that seek to do more. We will do that according to the timetable outlined yesterday.

            I am struggling to say something new, but older people form a high proportion of those cared for by the primary care trust in my constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)&#x2014;we share that primary care trust.</p><p>
            Community pharmacists are the friends of older people. They know them well because they know cf2their patients. Community pharmacists are also the friends of doctors, as I well know: a pharmacist once corrected me when I was very tired and made an error on a prescription. Doctors rely on pharmacists to check and ensure that they are doing the right thing&#x2014;

            I will ensure that community pharmacists remain for the sake of our people. The hon. Lady is right: community pharmacists on the high street, at the bottom of the road, in rural areas and in towns, know the patients' family history. They come to know people over time and provide a valuable service. That is why there has been concern throughout the House about the OFT report, and why representations have been made throughout the country. We are considering those representations carefully. In "Pharmacy in the Future" we set out a vision for pharmacists that they support.</p><p>
            The OFT report considers only 20 per cent. of the pharmacy business. The other 80 per cent. is NHS business. That is why we need to consider the matter carefully in the context of the needs of the NHS. We must support community pharmacists and I assure the hon. Lady that we are seeking to do that.
