            On 27 February, we reiterated to strategic health authorities that they should report whether the continuing care criteria in use since 1996 are consistent with the Coughlan judgment, and if not, when that was identified and what action was taken. We asked for an estimate of the number of people who might have been wrongly assessed and reiterated to strategic health authorities that they should agree one set of criteria across their area. We expect the results of those considerations to be reported back to the Department of

            It is important that transparent and consistent criteria are applied across the country. Tomorrow is the closing date for strategic health authorities to report back on their reviews of the criteria and the number of people who are likely to be affected. Will the Minister give an assurance that the Department will publish that information, and that an early assessment will be made of the total financial implications? If those implications are significant, how will they be met? Is contingency funding available to the strategic health authorities?

            The hon. Gentleman is right that we need first to assess those results and then, as we have said previously, to ensure that strategic health authorities have criteria that cover the whole of their area to ensure greater consistency. On the whole, the guidance that we have issued has ensured that in most areas health bodies have carried out the assessments in line with the legislation. In the light of the urgent action that we took after the issue of the health ombudsman's report, we must carefully consider how to ensure that older people are confident that their needs are properly assessed and that they receive the appropriate support for those needs, whether that is through continuing NHS health care, a contribution to nursing care, or a means-tested contribution elsewhere.

            I am sure that the Minister appreciates that the health service ombudsman's ability to deal with any issue is partly conditioned by the resources at her disposal. As complaints about the NHS increase and more cases are referred to the HSO, it is taking longer to get an adjudication. What are the Government doing to increase the resources available to the HSO, so that people who complain about something materially important to them get a quicker and more effective determination?

            On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I seek your advice on the procedure for notifying Members of cross-cutting Question Times. Only 17 Members submitted questions for the session that we have just concluded, hence the large number of Liberal Democrat colleagues whose names appeared on the Order Paper. Could steps be taken to ensure that more Members table questions for cross-cutting Questions Times?

            On a separate point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. You will have noticed that our most intense exchange was about community pharmacies. By way of setting a marker for further consideration in what is an experimental process, may I ask that the House authorities ensure that the distribution of Ministers assigned to respond is coincident with the questions asked? It would have been extremely helpful to everyone had a DTI Minister been here alongside his Department of Health colleague to respond to questions about community pharmacies. Instead, we had the not inelegant spectacle of a Minister of State at the Department for Education and Skills, the hon. Member for Barking (Margaret Hodge), having to answer not a specific question, but one of only general concern to her. None the less, we had no DTI Minister. It was a little like "Hamlet" without the prince.

            I am sure that Ministers are grateful for that helpful suggestion.</p><p>
            As I said at the beginning, we are still at a very experimental stage with the present procedure. Hon. Members may need to think about the questions that they table, because they will be slightly different from those that they would table for a single-Department answer in the House.</p><p>
            As I said, I am very willing to receive ideas and suggestions, and I am quite sure that Ministers are listening. Indeed, the Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office, listened to a great part of this cross-cutting Question Time and to the previous one as well. We will perhaps find our way through to a system that makes the most of the idea.
